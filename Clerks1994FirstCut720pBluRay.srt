1
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,480
Hello.

2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,899
What?

3
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,486
No, I don't work today.

4
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,155
I'm playing hockey at 2:00.

5
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,452
Why don't you call Randal?

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,039
Because I'm fucking tired.

7
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,543
I just closed last night.

8
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,670
Don't give me this.

9
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,883
What time do you think
you're gonna come in, 1 2:00?

10
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,970
Be there by 1 2:00? Swear.

11
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,557
Swear you'll be there by 1 2:00
and I'll do it.

12
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,352
Twelve or I walk.

13
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,794
Shit.

14
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,479
Thanks. Have a good one.

15
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,815
-Do you mind if I drink this here?
-Sure, go ahead.

16
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,234
-You open?
-Yeah.

17
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,946
-Pack of cigarettes.
-Are you sure?

18
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,240
-Am I sure?
-Are you sure?

19
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,450
Am I sure about what?

20
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,493
Do you really wanna buy
those cigarettes?

21
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,246
-Are you serious?
-How long have you been smoking?

22
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,082
-What is this? A poll?
-How long have you been a smoker?

23
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,045
-I don't know. Since I was about 1 3.
-Thirteen.

24
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,131
Let's see.
You are about 1 9, 20, am I right?

25
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,760
-What in the hell is that?
-That's your lung.

26
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,138
By this time, your lung looks like this.

27
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,683
-You've gotta be shitting me.
-You think I'm shitting you?

28
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,018
Here.

29
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,853
-What's this?
-It is a trach ring.

30
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,146
It's what they install in your throat

31
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,857
when throat cancer
takes your voice box.

32
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,359
This one came out
of a 60-year-old man.

33
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,361
Oh, God.

34
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,863
He smoked until the day he died.

35
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,366
He used to put the cigarette in this
and smoke it that way.

36
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,785
-Could you. . .
-This is where you're heading.

37
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,537
Cruddy lung,
smoking through a hole in your throat.

38
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,789
Do you really want that?

39
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,750
-Well, if it is already too late, I guess. . .
-No, it's never too late.

40
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,379
Put the cigarettes back
and try some gum instead.

41
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,423
-Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
-It's not the same.

42
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,885
It's cheaper than cigarettes
and it certainly beats this.

43
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,806
-Oh, Jesus.
-It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung.

44
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,766
Keep it.

45
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,519
-I'll just take the gum.
-Fifty-five.

46
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,314
You made a very wise choice.
Keep up the good work.

47
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,237
If you're gonna drink that coffee,
I think you ought to take it outside.

48
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,531
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.

49
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,408
Well, if you're gonna drink it in here,

50
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,868
I appreciate it
if you don't bother the customers.

51
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,246
Okay. I'm sorry about that.

52
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,291
Pack of cigarettes.

53
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,794
-What's that?
-This?

54
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,004
How long you been smoking?

55
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,106
We need some tits and ass. Yeah !

56
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,243
I feel good today, Silent Bob.
We're gonna make some money.

57
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,079
And then we're gonna go to that party
and get some pussy.

58
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,707
I'm gonna fuck this bitch,
I'm gonna fuck this bitch.

59
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,084
I'll fuck anything that moves.

60
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,047
What the fuck you looking at?
I'll kick your fucking ass. Shit, yeah.

61
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,467
Don't that motherfucker
owe me 1 0 bucks?

62
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,303
You know, tonight,
we're gonna rip off this fucker's head.

63
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,096
Take out his fucking soul.

64
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,514
If he tries to buy something,

65
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,642
I'm gonna shit
in the motherfucker's bag.

66
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,395
Yeah, what's up, baby?
What's up, sluts?

67
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,441
Silent Bob, you're a rude motherfucker,
you know?

68
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,819
But you're cute as hell.
I'd like to go down on you, suck you.

69
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,156
Line up three other guys,
make like a circus seal.

70
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,995
Oh, you fucking faggot, I hate guys.
I love women.

71
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,039
What you want, Grizzly Adams?

72
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,418
You're spending, what, 20, maybe $30
a week on your cigarettes?

73
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,711
-Yeah.
-Forty.

74
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,837
Fifty-three.

75
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,924
Fifty-three dollars
a week on cigarettes? Come on.

76
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,635
Would you give somebody that
much money each week to kill you?

77
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,220
Because that's what you're doing now

78
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,889
by paying for this so-called privilege
to smoke.

79
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,766
Hey, man, we gotta croak sometime.

80
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,687
It's that kind of mentality that allows
the cancer-producing industry to thrive.

81
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,690
Of course we're all gonna die someday.
But do we have to pay for it?

82
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,858
No, no.

83
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,693
Do we have to actually throw
hard-earned dollars

84
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,195
down on a counter and say

85
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,739
"Please, Mr. Merchant of Death,
sir, please.

86
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,034
"Sell me something
that will stink up breath and my clothes

87
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,327
"and fry my lungs"?

88
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,870
-Now, wait a second.
-Yeah.

89
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,790
Yeah, here comes the speech
about how he's just doing his job

90
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,875
by following orders.

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,877
Let me tell you about
another group of hate mongers

92
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,546
that were following orders.

93
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,548
-They were called Nazis.
-Nazis, that's right.

94
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,049
-Fucking Nazi.
-Yeah.

95
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,885
And they practically wiped
an entire nation of people off the Earth

96
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,762
just like cigarettes are doing now.

97
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,349
-I think you got to leave now.
-You want me to leave? Why?

98
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,268
Because somebody's telling it like it is?

99
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,813
Somebody's giving these fine people
a wake-up call?

100
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,274
No, you're loitering
and causing a disturbance.

101
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,026
I'm a disturbance?
You're the disturbance, pal.

102
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,030
You know? Here. Now I am a customer.
I'm gonna buy some Chewlies Gum.

103
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,407
All right? I'm a customer

104
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,909
engaged in a discussion
with the other customers.

105
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,412
-That's right.
-Yeah, now shut up so he can speak.

106
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,791
Yeah. See, he's scared now.
Because he sees the threat we present.

107
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,544
-He smells the changes coming.
-You can smell it.

108
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,588
You definitely are
the source in this area

109
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,506
and we're gonna shut you down
for good.

110
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,383
For good, cancer merchant.

111
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,678
Cancer merchant, cancer merchant.

112
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,393
Who's leading this mob?

113
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,272
That guy.

114
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,482
Freeze.

115
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,403
What's going on?

116
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,867
Let's see some credentials. Slowly.

117
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,455
You're a Chewlies Gum
representative?

118
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,539
Chewlies?

119
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,125
And you're stirring up all this
antismoking sentiment

120
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,713
to what, sell more gum?
Get out of here.

121
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,466
And you people,
don't you have jobs to go to?

122
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,301
Get out of here. Go commute.

123
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,053
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

124
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,263
Bunch of easily led automatons.

125
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,893
Try thinking for yourselves before you
pelt an innocent man with cigarettes.

126
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,734
Pack of cigarettes.

127
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,328
All right. Don't you think
you're taking this a bit too hard?

128
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,039
Too hard?
I have enough indignities in my life

129
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,083
and people start
throwing cigarettes at me.

130
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,002
-Least they weren't lit.
-Oh, I hate this fucking place.

131
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,338
Then quit.
You should be going to school anyway.

132
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,007
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
at this point is a lecture.

133
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,885
All I'm saying is if you're that unhappy,
you should leave.

134
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,970
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

135
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,847
I know. I stopped by your house.

136
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,308
Your mom told me you left,
like, at 6:00.

137
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,769
The guy got sick. He couldn't come in.

138
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,604
Don't you have a hockey game at 2:00?

139
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,981
Yes. And I'm gonna play like shit

140
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,150
because I didn't have
a good night's sleep.

141
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,652
Why'd you agree to come in, then?

142
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,862
Hey, I'm only here until 1 2:00.
After that, I'm gone.

143
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,072
The boss comes in.

144
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,032
Open the shutters, get sunlight in here.

145
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,035
-Someone jammed gum in the locks.
-You're kidding.

146
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,329
Bunch of savages in this town.

147
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,294
Thanks.

148
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,171
How much money
did you leave up there?

149
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,049
Like, $3 in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

150
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,885
This time in the morning,
people just get paper or coffee.

151
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,555
-You're trusting.
-Why do you say that?

152
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,765
How do you know they're taking
the right change?

153
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,559
Or even paying for what they take?

154
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,395
Theoretically, people see money
on the counter and no one around,

155
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,355
they think they're being watched.

156
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,483
Honesty through paranoia.

157
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,068
Why do you smell like shoe polish?

158
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,237
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

159
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,823
The smell won't come off.

160
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,909
Do you think anybody
can see us down here?

161
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,953
Why?
Do you wanna have sex or something?

162
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,413
Can we?

163
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,665
-Really?
-I was kidding.

164
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,210
-Like you can't get enough of me.
-Typically male point of view.

165
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,754
How do you figure?

166
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,923
You show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

167
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,426
-What about what we do for you?
-Women?

168
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,094
Women as lovers
are basically the same.

169
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,679
They just have to be there.

170
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,805
Be there?

171
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,141
Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

172
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:52,645
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

173
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,606
How flattering.

174
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,776
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

175
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,235
Oh, you think so?

176
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,280
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

177
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,033
A guy makes a woman come, it's talent.

178
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,535
-And I actually date you?
-Something wrong?

179
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,621
I'm insulted.

180
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,540
Believe me, Don Juan,
it takes more than that to get a guy off.

181
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,168
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

182
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,961
Oh, I've touched a nerve.

183
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,964
I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life.

184
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,467
It wasn't directed at you.
I was making a broad generalization.

185
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,094
You were making a generalization
about broads.

186
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,971
Those are my opinions
based on the few women

187
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,641
who were goodly enough
to sleep with me.

188
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,643
-How many?
-How many what?

189
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,436
How many different girls
have you slept with?

190
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,356
How many different girls?
Didn't we have this discussion once?

191
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,067
We might have, I don't remember.
How many?

192
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,987
-Including you?
-It better be up to and including me.

193
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,574
-Twelve.
-You've slept with 1 2 different girls?

194
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,410
Including you, yes.

195
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,620
What'd you do that for?

196
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,871
-You're a pig.
-Why'd you hit me?

197
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,581
Know how many men I've had sex with?

198
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,626
-Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
-Three.

199
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,003
-Three?
-Three including you.

200
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,672
You've only slept with three people?

201
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,423
-I'm not the pig you are.
-Who?

202
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,718
-You.
-No. Who were the three besides me?

203
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,180
John Francin and Rob Stanslik.

204
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,183
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me sick.

205
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,018
You'll sleep with anything
that says yes.

206
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,230
-Animal, mineral or vegetable.
-Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

207
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,357
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

208
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,026
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

209
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,611
Name it.

210
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,238
I want you to come with me on Monday.

211
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,156
-Where?
-To school.

212
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,368
There's a seminar about getting back
into a scholastic program

213
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,161
after a lapse in enrolment.

214
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,372
Can't we ever have a discussion
without that coming up?

215
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,874
It's important to me, Dante.

216
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,710
You have so much potential
that's going to waste in this pit.

217
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,919
I wish you'd go back to school.

218
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,547
Jesus, will you stop it?
You're making my head hurt.

219
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,965
Shit. Why are we getting up?

220
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,218
Unlike you,
I have a class in 45 minutes.

221
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,223
-Willam.
-Oh, hey, Ronni. How you been, man?

222
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:58,563
-What, do you work here now?
-No, I was visiting my man.

223
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,233
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

224
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,779
-How you doing? Just the soda?
-No, and a pack of cigarettes.

225
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:11,075
So where you been, man?
Are you still going to Seton Hall?

226
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,371
No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing him.

227
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,790
That's beautiful, man.

228
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,919
So you still talk to Silvan?

229
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,005
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

230
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,424
Oh, that's great.

231
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,844
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay?

232
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,638
Bye. Take it easy.

233
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,851
-That was Snowball.
-Why do you call him that?

234
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,647
Silvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.

235
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,273
What do you mean?

236
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,650
After he gets a blow job,

237
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,694
he likes to have it spit back
into his mouth while kissing.

238
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,112
It's called snowballing.

239
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,032
-He requests this?
-He gets off on it.

240
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,284
Silvan can be talked into anything.

241
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,746
-Why do you say that?
-Like you said, she snowballed him.

242
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,125
-Silvan? No, I snowballed him.
-Yeah, right.

243
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,211
I'm serious.

244
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,296
You sucked that guy's dick?

245
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,340
Yeah, how do you think
I knew that he. . .

246
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,258
But you said you only had sex
with three guys.

247
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,053
-You never mentioned him.
-Because I never had sex with him.

248
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,304
You sucked his dick.

249
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,472
We went out a few times.

250
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,224
We never had sex,
but we fooled around.

251
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,475
Oh, my God.

252
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,602
Why'd you tell me you had sex
with three guys?

253
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,146
Because I did only have sex
with three different guys.

254
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,940
That doesn't mean
I didn't go with people.

255
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,400
Oh, my God, I feel so nauseous.

256
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,986
I'm sorry, Dante.
I thought you understood.

257
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,320
I did understand.

258
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,198
I understood that you had sex with
three guys and that's all you said.

259
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,992
-Please calm down.
-How many?

260
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,952
-Dante. . .
-How many dicks have you sucked?

261
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,496
-How many?
-All right. Shut up and I'll tell you.

262
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,582
Jesus. I didn't freak out when you
told me how many girls you fucked.

263
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,419
This is different. This is important.
How many?

264
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,015
Well?

265
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,352
Something like 36.

266
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,938
-What? Something like 36?
-Lower your voice.

267
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,065
What is that anyway,
"Something like 36"?

268
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,526
Does that include me?

269
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,863
-Thirty-seven.
-I'm 37?

270
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,366
-I'm going to class.
-Oh, my God.

271
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,202
Thirty-seven?
My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

272
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,872
-In a row?
-Hey, where are you going?

273
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,875
Until today you never even knew
how many guys I'd slept with

274
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,668
because you never even bothered
to ask.

275
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,879
Then you act all nonchalant
about fucking 1 2 girls.

276
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,882
-I never had sex with 1 2 different guys.
-No, but you sucked enough dick.

277
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,925
-Yeah, I went down on a few guys.
-A few?

278
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,218
And one of those guys was you.

279
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,263
The last one, I might add, which,
if you're too stupid to comprehend,

280
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,432
means I've been faithful to you
since we met.

281
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,768
All the other guys I went with
before I met you.

282
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,352
If you wanna have a complex,
go ahead.

283
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,645
But don't look at me like a town whore

284
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,731
because you were busy
before you met me.

285
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,399
Why did you have to suck their dick?

286
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,568
Why couldn't you sleep with them
like any decent person?

287
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,403
Because going down isn't a big deal.

288
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,448
I used to like a guy, we'd make out,
and sooner or later, I'd go down on him.

289
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,617
But I only had sex with the guys I loved.

290
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,411
-I feel sick.
-I love you. Don't feel sick.

291
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,914
Every time I kiss you,
I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.

292
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,625
I'm going to school. Maybe later
you'll be a bit more rational.

293
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,711
-Thirty-seven. I just can't. . .
-Goodbye, Dante.

294
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,093
Hey, try not to suck any dick
on your way through the parking lot.

295
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,428
Hey, hey, you. Get back here.

296
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,270
I thought that place was supposed
to be opened at 1 1 :00.

297
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,605
It's 1 1 :20.

298
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,150
I've already called his house twice.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

299
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,737
Hey. It's not like it's a demanding job
over there.

300
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,448
I'd like to get paid
to sit on my ass and watch TV.

301
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,118
I walked in here the other day,
that son of a bitch was sleeping.

302
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,162
-I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
-Are you calling me a liar?

303
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,041
-Are you calling me a liar?
-No, he was probably resting his eyes.

304
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,377
What the hell is that,
"Resting his eyes"?

305
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,295
What, like he's some
air traffic controller?

306
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,464
Actually, that's his night job.

307
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,051
Wiseass too, huh?
Go ahead, keep cracking wise.

308
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,012
That's why you're jockeying a register
in some local convenience store

309
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,640
instead of working at a steady job.

310
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,727
Look, I've got no time to bullshit around
here waiting for that son of a bitch.

311
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,771
Make sure he gets that.

312
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,732
The number's 81 2.
My name's Wynarski.

313
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,317
And I wanted a movie tonight.

314
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,862
If you'll tell me the title,
I'm sure he'll hold it for you.

315
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,907
Don't hurt yourself, buddy.
I'll go to Big Choice Video instead.

316
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,831
You forgot your keys.

317
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,388
-Guy ain't here yet.
-You're kidding. It's almost 1 1 :30.

318
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,682
I know. I've been here since 1 1 :00.

319
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,226
Man, I hate it when I can't rent videos.

320
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,436
I would've went to Big Choice,

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,605
but the tape I want
is right there on that wall.

322
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,690
-Really? Which one?
-Dental School.

323
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,151
You came for that too?
That's the movie I came for.

324
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,195
-I have first dibs.
-Says who?

325
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,406
Says me. I've been here for
half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.

326
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,867
Ain't gonna happen, my friend.
I'm getting that movie.

327
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,243
Like hell you are.

328
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,079
I'll bet you 20 bucks
you don't get to rent that tape.

329
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,706
-Twenty bucks?
-Twenty bucks.

330
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,042
All right, asshole, you're on.

331
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,270
-You're late.
-What the hell are you doing here?

332
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,521
I thought you were playing hockey.

333
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,441
-Boss called. Arthur fell ill.
-Why the shutters closed?

334
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,277
-Someone jammed gum in the locks.
-Bunch of savages in this town.

335
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,403
That's what I said.

336
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,740
Shit, if I'd known you were here,
I'd have come even later.

337
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,660
-What smells like shoe polish?
-Go open the store.

338
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,624
Hey, you see a set of keys
around here?

339
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,085
No time for love, Dr. Jones.

340
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,171
Fucking kids.

341
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,946
Some guy just came in
refusing to pay late fees.

342
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,448
He said the store was closed
for two hours yesterday.

343
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,285
-I tore up his membership.
-A shocking abuse of authority.

344
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,121
Hey, I'm a firm believer
in the philosophy of a ruling class.

345
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,539
Especially since I rule.

346
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,125
You want something to drink?
I'm buying.

347
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,626
No, thanks.

348
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,837
Who's on your phone this morning
at 2:30?

349
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,131
-I was trying to call for a half an hour.
-Why?

350
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,509
I wanted to use your car. Snack cake.

351
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,971
-You don't wanna know.
-You called Caitlin again?

352
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,764
-She called me.
-Did you tell Veronica?

353
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,392
One fight a day with Veronica
is all I can stomach. Thanks.

354
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,228
-What do you fight about?
-We don't fight about anything.

355
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,273
She just wants me to leave and go back
to school and get some direction.

356
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,984
I'll bet the most frequent topic
of arguments is Caitlin Bree.

357
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,445
-You win.
-I'm gonna offer you some advice.

358
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,947
Let the past be the past.
Forget Caitlin Bree.

359
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,283
-Been with Veronica how long now?
-Seven months.

360
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,785
Chick's nuts about you.
How long did you date Caitlin?

361
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,954
-Five years.
-Chick only made you nuts, man.

362
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,332
-She cheated on you how many times?
-Eight and a half.

363
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,834
-Eight and a half?
-Party at John Kay's, senior year.

364
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,627
I get blitzed,
passed out in his bedroom.

365
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,212
Caitlin comes in and jumps all over me.

366
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,965
-So that's cheating?
-In the middle, she called me "Brad."

367
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,092
-She called you "Brad"?
-She called me "Brad."

368
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,887
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

369
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,390
-One time, I called this girl "Mom."
-I hit the lights and she freaks.

370
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,684
-She thought I was Brad Michelson.
-What do you mean?

371
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,770
She was supposed to meet Brad
in a bedroom.

372
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,189
She picked the wrong one.
She didn't know I was at the party.

373
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,690
-Oh, my God.
-Great story, huh?

374
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,401
-That girl was vile to you.
-Interesting postscript to that.

375
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,695
Do you know who wound up
in that bedroom with Brad?

376
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,364
-Your mother?
-Alan Harris.

377
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,032
Chess team Alan Harris?

378
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,117
The two moved to Idaho together
after graduation.

379
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,952
-They raise sheep.
-That's frightening.

380
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,621
It takes different strokes
to move the world.

381
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,872
In light of this lurid tale,

382
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,708
I don't see how you'd romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin.

383
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,294
Broke your heart
and drove men to deviant lifestyles.

384
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,296
-There's good in our relationship.
-Oh, yeah?

385
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,340
Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

386
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,258
I mean, that's what high school
is about.

387
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,219
Algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.

388
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,096
You think things will be different
this time?

389
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,890
They are. When she calls me now,
she's a different person.

390
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,392
She's frightened, vulnerable.

391
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,103
She's finishing college
and she's about to enter the real world.

392
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,563
-That's scary.
-I've got to place an order.

393
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,731
I'm talking to myself here.

394
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,650
I'm listening.
She's leaving college and. . .

395
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,318
And she's looking to me for support.

396
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,445
This is leading our relationship
to a new level.

397
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,780
And what about Veronica?

398
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,783
I think the arguments we are having
are some kind of manifestation

399
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,827
of a subconscious desire
to break up with her

400
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,121
so I can pursue a more meaningful
relationship with Caitlin.

401
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,165
-And Caitlin's on the same wavelength?
-I think it's safe to say yes.

402
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,501
All of you had better sit down
and talk it over.

403
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,295
-All four?
-You, Veronica, Caitlin,

404
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,839
and Caitlin's fiance.

405
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,643
Excuse me. Do you sell video tapes?

406
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:01,021
-Yeah. What are you looking for?
-Happy Scrappy, Hero Pup?

407
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,607
One second. I'm on the phone
with the distribution house now.

408
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,443
-Let me make sure they got it.
-Okay.

409
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,652
What's it called again?

410
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,280
-Happy Scrappy, Hero Pup.
-Happy Scrappy.

411
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,365
-She loves it.
-Obviously.

412
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,745
Yeah. Hi, this is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.

413
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,914
I'd like to place an order.

414
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,250
Okay.
I need one each of the following tapes,

415
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,502
Whispers in the Wind,

00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,672
Put lt Where lt Doesn't Belong,

417
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,967

Oh, yeah and All Holes Filled
With Hard Cock. Yup.

425
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,869
Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?

426
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,684
Yes, I'd like to check
on a misprint in today's edition?

427
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,561
Today's edition.

428
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,648
It says
"Bree to wed Asian design major."

429
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,359
No, no, everything's spelled fine.

430
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,904
I was just wondering
if the article was a misprint.

431
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,240
I don't know. Like a typographical error
or something?

432
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,534
I don't know.
Maybe it should say "Caitlin Bray"

433
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,953
or "Caitlin Bre" with one E.

434
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,665
I'm a curious party. A curious party.

435
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,045
I'm an ex-boyfriend and, well,
it's just that I talk to her all the time

436
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,630
and she never mentioned
this engagement.

437
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,633
That's why I'm thinking,
maybe it's a misprint.

438
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,970
Are you sure?

439
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,598
I mean, maybe there's
a vindictive printer working for you.

440
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,933
Meaning, like, I don't know,

441
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,394
someone who asked her out once
and got shot down.

442
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,355
And this is his revenge by putting
this bogus article in the paper

443
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,399
when it went to the press.

444
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,109
Hello? Hello?

445
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,036
I don't care if she's my cousin or not,

446
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,581
I'm gonna knock
those boots again tonight.

447
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,833
Well, look who it is,
the fucking human vacuum.

448
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,209
Scumbag, what are you doing?

449
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,086
I'm hanging with Silent Bob
and his cousin.

450
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,296
He's your cousin?

451
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,674
-Yeah, and he's from Russia too.
-No way. What part of Russia?

452
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,176
I don't fucking know.
Do I look like his fucking biographer?

453
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,430
Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?

454
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,932
-Moscow.
-He only speaks Russian?

455
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,643
No, he speaks some English,
but he cannot speak it like we do.

456
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,811
Is he staying here?

457
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,605
No, he's moving
to the big city this week.

458
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,024
-He wants to be a metal singer.
-No way.

459
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,192
I swear. Olaf, metal.

460
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,655
That's his fucking metal face.
Olaf, girl nice?

461
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,492
-That's fucked up, man.
-What did he say?

462
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,828
I don't know, man,
but this guy's a character.

463
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,246
He really wants to play metal?

464
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,831
Yeah. He's got his own band
in Moscow.

465
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,374
It's called
Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans

466
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,626
or something like that.

467
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,753
-Doesn't sound metal.
-You gotta hear him sing.

468
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,047
Olaf, "Berserker."

469
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,132
Come on, man, "Berserker."

470
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,842
Does he sing in English or Russian?

471
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,055
In English. Come on, "Berserker."
Girls think sexy.

472
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,225
Watch, wait, he's gonna sing it.
Watch, it's too funny.

473
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,855
My love for you is like a truck
Berserker

474
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,984
Would you like some making fuck
Berserker

475
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,071
-That's fucking funny, man.
-Did he sing "Making fuck"?

476
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:02,346
My love for you is ticking clock
Berserker

477
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,475
Would you like to suck my cock
Berserker

478
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,770
That's beautiful, man.

479
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,111
Hold on to the counter and I'll pull.

480
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,364
Usually I just turn the can upside down.

481
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,700
Maybe we ought to soap your hand up.

482
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,660
They ought to put a warning
on these things.

483
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,037
-Like they do with cigarettes.
-Oh, I think it's coming.

484
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,545
Thanks.
I thought I had to go to the hospital.

485
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,631
I'll throw this out
as a precautionary measure.

486
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,299
It stings a little.

487
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,968
A little word of advice, my friend.

488
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,388
Sometimes you gotta let
those hard to reach chips go.

489
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,806
Thanks.

490
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,728
You know that article's accurate?
Caitlin really is getting married.

491
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,895
Know what I just watched?

492
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,647
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist?

493
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,399
Return of the Jedi.

494
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,736
Didn't you hear me?
Caitlin is really getting married.

495
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,489
Which did you like better,
Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?

496
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,658
-Empire.
-Blasphemy.

497
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,077
Empire had the better ending.

498
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,248
I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

499
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,292
Han gets frozen,
taken away by Boba Fett.

500
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,585
It ends on such a down note.

501
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,380
I mean, that's what life is,
a series of down endings.

502
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,632
All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

503
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,426
There was something else
going on in Jedi.

504
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,178
I never noticed it until today.

505
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,263
-They build another Death Star, right?
-Yeah.

506
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,515
Now, the first one was completed
and fully operational

507
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,975
before the Rebels destroyed it.

508
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,894
Luke blew it up.
Give credit where credit's due.

509
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,188
Second one was still being built
when they blew it up.

510
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,814
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

511
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,609
Something just never sat right with me
that second time around.

512
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,943
I could never put my finger on it.

513
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,613
-But something just wasn't right.
-And you figured it out.

514
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,324
The first Death Star was manned
by the Imperial Army.

515
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,284
The only people onboard
were stormtroopers,

516
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,204
-dignitaries, Imperials.
-Basically.

517
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,956
So when they blew it up,
no problem, evil is punished.

518
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,124
And the second time around?

519
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,502
The second time around,
it wasn't even done being built yet.

520
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,796
-It was still under construction.
-So?

521
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,340
So a construction job of that magnitude
would require

522
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,384
a hell of a lot more manpower
than the Imperial Army had to offer.

523
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,262
I'll bet they brought independent
contractors in on that thing.

524
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,973
-Plumbers, aluminum-siders, roofers. . .
-Not just Imperialists.

525
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,475
-Is that what you're getting at?
-Exactly.

526
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,312
To get it built quickly and quietly,
they'd hire anybody that can do the job.

527
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,815
Think the average stormtrooper
knows how to install a toilet main?

528
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,108
All they know is killing
and white uniforms.

529
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,611
All right, so they bring in
independent contractors.

530
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,446
Why are you so upset
at its destruction?

531
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,658
All those innocent contractors
brought in to do the job were killed.

532
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,660
Casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

533
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,496
All right, look. You're a roofer.

534
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,915
Some juicy government contract
comes your way,

535
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,709
you got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

536
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,004
This is a government contract,
which means all sorts of benefits.

537
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,506
Along come these left-wing militants

538
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,342
that blast everything
within a 3-mile radius with their lasers.

539
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,719
You did not ask for that.
You had no personal politics.

540
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,680
You're trying to scrape out a living.

541
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,182
I don't mean to interrupt,
but what are you talking about?

542
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,851
The ending of Return of the Jedi.

543
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,728
My friend is trying to convince me
that any independent contractors

544
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,730
who were working
on the uncompleted Death Star

545
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,316
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed by the Rebels.

546
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,027
Well, I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

547
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,489
Done and Ready Home Improvements.
And speaking as a roofer,

548
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,368
I can tell you a roofer's personal politics
comes into play when choosing jobs.

549
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,536
Like when?

550
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,788
Three weeks ago,
I was offered a job up in the hills.

551
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,959
A beautiful house. Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

552
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,005
They told me if I could finish it
in one day, I would double my price.

553
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,924
-Then I realized whose house it was.
-Whose house was it?

554
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,012
-Dominic Bambino's.
-"Baby Face" Bambino? The gangster?

555
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,724
The same. The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

556
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:37,895
I knew who he was and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend of mine.

557
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,855
Based on personal politics.

558
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,399
Right. And the next week
the Forsie family

559
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,735
put a hit on Baby Face's house.

560
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,196
My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.

561
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,323
No way.

562
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,493
I'm alive because I knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

563
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,579
My friend wasn't so lucky.

564
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:59,583
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

565
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,669
If they got killed, it's their own fault.

566
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,547
A roofer listens to this, not his wallet.

567
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,853
They say so much,
but they never tell you if it's any good.

568
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,692
Are either one of these any good?

569
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,487
-Sir?
-What?

570
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,907
-Are either one of these any good?
-I don't watch movies.

571
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,744
Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them?

572
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,997
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

573
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,210
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these?

574
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,711
Nope.

575
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,219
-Well, what about these two?
-Oh, they suck.

576
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,724
These are the same two movies.
You weren't paying any attention.

577
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,810
No, I wasn't.

578
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,812
I don't think your manager
would appreciate it. . .

579
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,190
-I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
-I beg your pardon?

580
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,193
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

581
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,696
I was only pointing out

582
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,156
that you weren't paying any attention
to what I was saying.

583
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,702
-And I hope it feels good.
-You hope what feels good?

584
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,997
I hope it feels so good to be right.
There's nothing more exhilarating

585
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,917
than pointing out the shortcomings
of others, is there?

586
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,587
-Well, this is the last time I rent here.
-You'll be missed.

587
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,131
Screw you.

588
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,760
Hey, you're not allowed
to rent here anymore.

589
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,179
Yeah !

590
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,556
Screw me?

591
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,613
You'll never believe
what this unruly customer just said.

592
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,365
-Wait.
-She in here?

593
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,909
This guy is going through all the eggs.
Look.

594
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,703
This has been going on for 20 minutes.

595
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,121
What's he looking for?

596
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,749
-Said he has to find the perfect dozen.
-Perfect dozen?

597
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,917
Yeah. Each egg has to be perfect.

598
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,045
-The quest isn't going well, huh?
-Obviously not.

599
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,921
Look at the cartons
that didn't make the grade.

600
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,548
Why doesn't he mix and match?

601
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,176
-I told him and he yelled at me.
-What did he say?

602
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,927
He said it was important
to have standards.

603
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,639
-He said nobody has pride anymore.
-It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.

604
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,267
Five minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

605
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,979
I don't need this. I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

606
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,441
Two packs of cigarettes.

607
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,779
I'm as puzzled as you.

608
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,490
-I've actually seen it before.
-You know him?

609
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,450
I don't know him,
but I know the behavior.

610
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,828
-Looking for the perfect carton of eggs?
-Yeah. How'd you know?

611
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,331
And I'll bet you a million dollars
he's a guidance counselor.

612
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,582
Why do you say that?

613
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,210
Well, I saw it happen
in Food City, like, last year.

614
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,669
Different guy though.

615
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,837
Stock boy said that he'd been

616
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,589
looking through cartons of eggs
for half an hour,

617
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,342
doing all sorts of endurance tests
and stuff.

618
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,052
I ask them why nobody
ever called the manager,

619
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,013
and he said it happens, like, two,
three times a week, sometimes more.

620
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,015
-Get out of here.
-No, I kid you not.

621
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,600
They call it shell shock.

622
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,685
Seems to only happens
with guidance counselors.

623
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,480
They used to make a big deal of it,
but they let it go

624
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,273
because they always
pay for whatever they break

625
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,858
and they never bother anybody.

626
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,568
Why guidance counselors?

627
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,030
Well, if your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too?

628
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,991
Come to think of it, my guidance
counselor was kind of worthless.

629
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,953
See? It's important to have a job
that makes a difference, boys.

630
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,413
That's why I manually masturbate
caged animals

631
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,290
for artificial insemination.

632
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,663
You ever notice that all the prices
end in nine?

633
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,665
Damn, that's eerie.

634
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,334
You know how much money the
average jizz-mopper makes per hour?

635
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,752
What's a jizz-mopper?

636
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,839
The guy that cleans out the nudie booth
after each guy jerks off.

637
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,216
-"Nudie booth"?
-Yeah, nudie booth.

638
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,635
-Never been in a nudie booth?
-Guess not.

639
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,012
Oh, man, it's great.

640
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,265
You go to this booth and there's this
glass between you and these chicks

641
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,517
and they put on a show for you for like
for, like, 1 0 bucks.

642
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,768
What kind of a show?

643
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,813
Think of the weirdest,
craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.

644
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,190
I mean, these chicks do it all.

645
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,818
They insert things into any opening
on their body. Any opening.

646
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,986
Can we not talk about this now?

647
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,156
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

648
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,534
Everybody does it right on the window.
I don't know if you noticed,

649
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,703
but cum leaves streaks
if you don't clean it right away.

650
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,998
-I will never come to this place again.
-Excuse me?

651
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,167
Using filthy language
in front of the customers.

652
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,002
You both should be fired.

653
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,422
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess we kind of got carried away.

654
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,217
Well, I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

655
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,344
You've highly offended me.

656
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,140
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

657
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,601
I think you can see her kidneys.

658
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,269
Why do you do things like that?

659
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,271
You know he's gonna come back
and tell the boss.

660
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,065
Who cares? That guy's an asshole.

661
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,400
Everybody that comes in here
is way too uptight.

662
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,736
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the customers.

663
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,571
I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.

664
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,198
Oh, would you loosen up?

665
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,407
You'd feel a hell of a lot better

666
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,701
if you'd rip into
the occasional customer.

667
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,496
Why? I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

668
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,581
Liar. Tell me there aren't customers

669
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,251
that annoy the piss out of you
on a daily basis.

670
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,670
-There aren't.
-How can you lie like that?

671
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,589
Why don't you vent?
Vent your frustrations.

672
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,342
Come on. Who pisses you off?

673
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,596
Well, I guess it isn't customers
in particular.

674
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,890
Maybe just a group of customers.

675
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,686
-Well, let's hear it.
-Well, the milkmaids.

676
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,563
The milkmaids?

677
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,234
The women that go through every
gallon of milk looking for that later date

678
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,444
as if somewhere beyond
all the other gallons

679
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,073
is a container of milk that won't go bad
for, like, a decade.

680
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,325
You know who I can do without?

681
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,536
I could do without the people
in the video store.

682
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,997
-Which ones?
-All of them.

683
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,375
What would you get for a 6-year-old
boy who chronically wets his bed?

684
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,294
So do you have any new movies in?

685
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,297
Do you have that one with that guy

686
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,258
who was in that movie
that was out last year?

687
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,968
They never rent quality flicks.

688
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,096
They always pick the most intellectually
devoid movie on the racks.

689
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,141
Navy Seals.

690
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,561
It's like in order to join, they have
to have an IQ less than their shoe size.

691
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,021
Think you get stupid questions?

692
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,565
You should hear the barrage
of stupid questions I get.

693
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,443
What, there's no ice?
I gotta drink this coffee hot?

694
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,236
So how much is this thing anyway?

695
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,492
Do you sell hubcaps
for a '72 Pinto hatchback?

696
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,411
Oh, Mini Truckin' magazine.

697
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,164
See? You vented. Don't you feel better?

698
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,832
-No.
-Why not?

699
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,917
Because my ex-girlfriend's
getting married.

700
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,838
Jesus, you got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.

701
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,506
Veronica.

702
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,385
What happened to home by 1 2:00?

703
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,679
Boss hasn't shown up yet.
How come you're not in class?

704
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,224
Lit 1 01 got canceled so I stopped home
and I brought you some lunch.

705
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,517
What is it?

706
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,895
Peanut butter and jelly
with the crusts cut off.

707
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,732
-What do you think it is? It's lasagna.
-Really?

708
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,984
Oh, you're the queen.

709
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,987
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.

710
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,947
-Thirty-seven.
-Shut up.

711
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,620
Yes, I've calmed down.
I'm not happy, but I'll be able to deal.

712
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,290
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

713
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,587
You had to tell him?

714
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,006
I had to tell someone.
He put it into perspective.

715
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,926
-What did he say?
-He said at least he wasn't 36.

716
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,552
And that made you feel better?

717
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,888
And he also said
that most of them were college guys

718
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,306
I've never even seen or met before.

719
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,393
-Ostrich syndrome. If you don't see it. . .
-It isn't there, yes.

720
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,896
-Thank you for being rational.
-Thank you for the lasagna.

721
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,774
-Couldn't get the shutters open?
-No. I called a locksmith.

722
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,943
He said the earliest he could be here's
tomorrow morning.

723
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,737
Bummer. Well, I've gotta
head back for the 1 :30 class.

724
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,364
-What time do you get finished?
-Eight.

725
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,284
But I have a sorority meeting till 9:00,
so I'll see you when you close, then.

726
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,786
-Can we go out for coffee?
-Sure.

727
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,704
Good.

728
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,166
I'll see you when you close, then.
Enjoy the lasagna.

729
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,518
Vermont?

730
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,063
No, that can't be.
I just talked to him this morning.

731
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,149
He left at what time?

732
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,943
He really went to Vermont?

733
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,987
When the hell
was someone gonna tell me?

734
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,698
He promised me he'd be here by noon.

735
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,950
Jesus. When does he get back?

736
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,412
Tuesday? You gotta be kidding me.
I've got a hockey game at 2:00

737
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,914
and the steel shutters are
jammed closed and he's in Vermont?

738
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,625
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

739
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,548
So I'm stuck here until closing?

740
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,758
Oh, this is just great.

741
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,303
I can't fucking believe this.

742
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,891
No. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell at you.

743
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,810
Yeah, I know.

744
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,063
No, I'll be all right.

745
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,652
Well, that's all I can do, right? Yeah.
All right, thanks. Bye.

746
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,822
-Vermont?
-Can you fucking believe this?

747
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,199
He didn't mention that
to you this morning?

748
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,868
Not a word.
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.

749
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,329
-So, what, you're stuck here all day?
-Fuck!

750
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,164
-Why'd you apologize?
-What?

751
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,582
I heard you apologize. Why?

752
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,001
-You have every reason to be mad.
-I know.

753
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,796
Jesus. That seems to be the leitmotif
in your life, ever backing down.

754
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,882
-I don't back down.
-You always back down.

755
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,718
You assume blame that's not yours,
you come in on your day off,

756
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,053
you buckle like a belt.

757
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,931
-Know what pisses me off?
-That I'm right about your buckling?

758
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,475
-That I'm gonna miss the fucking game.
-Because you buckled.

759
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,020
-Shut up with that shit. It ain't helping.
-Don't yell at me, pal.

760
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,147
-I'm sorry.
-See? There you go again.

761
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,316
I can't believe
I'm gonna miss the game.

762
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,235
At least we're stuck here together.

763
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,070
You got a customer.

764
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,739
What? What do you want?

765
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,996
Oh, I can't fucking believe this.

766
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,958
Yeah, hello, Sanford? Dante.

767
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,170
I can't play today. I'm stuck at work.

768
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,508
Yeah, I know I'm not scheduled,
but I just. . . Forget it.

769
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:38,137
Point is I can't play today.
Neither can Randal. He's working too.

770
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,142
Hey, wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?

771
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,354
Hold on. You feeling limber?

772
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,742
-Pull my laces tighter, man.
-I've gotta tell you, my friend.

773
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,161
This is one of the ballsiest moves
I've been privy to.

774
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,331
I never thought you capable of such
a blatant disregard of store policy.

775
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,292
I told him I had a game today.
It's his own fault.

776
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,252
No arguments here.
Insubordination rules.

777
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,421
I want to play hockey
like I was scheduled to.

778
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,089
Hey, I'm gonna grab a Gatorade.

779
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,091
If you grab a Gatorade,
everybody's gonna grab one.

780
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,051
-So?
-So? Who's gonna pay?

781
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,137
What do you care,
shoe-polish-smelling motherfucker?

782
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,473
I have responsibility.
I can't have everybody grab free drinks.

783
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,018
What responsibility? You're closing
the fucking store to play hockey.

784
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,227
He's got a point.

785
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,646
Let me maintain some semblance
of managerial control.

786
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,399
If you're gonna be insubordinate,
might as well go the full nine,

787
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,109
not pussy out
when it comes to free shit to drink.

788
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,528
Right. As if we're gonna have a run
on Gatorade.

789
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,030
-Fucking-A.
-All right.

790
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,781
Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.

791
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,867
I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

792
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,619
-Design major.
-Can we not talk about this?

793
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,706
Fine by me. But you're living in denial
and suppressing rage, motherfucker.

794
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,417
-You gonna lock the store?
-You gonna lock the video store?

795
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,086
Look who you're asking.
How we gonna block the street?

796
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,882
-We're not playing in the street.
-Then where we gonna play?

797
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,849
Hit him, hit him, hit him.

798
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,065
Hit him.

799
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,947
Dante. Here, here, here.

800
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,951
Now, wait a second. . .

801
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,578
Hit him.

802
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,707
That's it.

803
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,252
I got him, I got him, I got him.
He's mine, mine, mine.

804
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,926
Over here, back, back, back.
Come on, get it.

805
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,512
-Clear the crease.
-Hit him.

806
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,846
Yeah.

807
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,309
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

808
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,604
-Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up.
-To the left, to the left.

809
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,565
Hit him.

810
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,404
Get him. All right, here we go,
I got, I got it. I'm here.

811
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,531
-When's this period over?
-Eight more minutes.

812
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,616
Are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.

813
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,493
If you can just wait
a few minutes, okay?

814
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,870
Fuck that. I'm gonna break
my neck on this ladder.

815
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,832
Now lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill,
and open the fucking store.

816
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,625
-Dante, where are you?
-He's busy.

817
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,836
-In a second.
-Fuck in a second.

818
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,131
-Look at you, you can't even pass.
-I can pass.

819
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,383
How about covering the point?
Man, you suck.

820
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,928
-Who are you to make assessments?
-Hey, I'll assess all I want, pal.

821
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,056
-Hey, Dante, you in or out?
-Don't pass to this guy. He sucks.

822
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,808
-You suck.
-Like you're better.

823
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,686
-I'll whip your ass any day, pal.
-That's easy to say from over here.

824
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,396
Give me a stick.

825
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,107
I'll knock your fucking teeth out
and pass all over your ass.

826
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,860
-Hey, are you open?
-Yeah, are you open?

827
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,194
-No.
-No.

828
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,866
There's a stick over there.
You're shooting up against this goal.

829
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,201
Hey, Redding, come off.
Let this fuck on.

830
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,786
Face-off, right here.

831
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,591
Oh, man. Nice hit.

832
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,385
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, get it.

833
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,180
Come on, come on.
Get him, get him, get him.

834
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,236
Give me another ball.

835
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,071
There are no more.

836
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,282
The fuck you talking about?
How many balls you bring?

837
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,702
I brought the orange one
and the orange one.

838
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,079
Hey, any balls down there?

839
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,541
About the biggest pair
you've ever seen, dingleberry.

840
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,712
-You only brought one ball?
-I thought Redding brought all the balls.

841
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,130
Dante had the balls.

842
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,549
-Nobody has another ball?
-Shit.

843
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,804
We get, what, 1 2 minutes of a game
and then it's over?

844
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,515
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

845
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,226
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

846
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,188
I still get free Gatorade, right?

847
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,077
-Be careful.
-I'm trying.

848
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,248
You know, the insides of those
has got stuff that can give you cancer.

849
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,458
-So I'm told.
-Yeah.

850
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,586
I had a friend that chewed glass
for a living.

851
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,921
At the circus.

852
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,298
And he got cancer
from chewing fluorescent-bulb glass?

853
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,551
No, got hit by a bus.

854
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,387
Can I help you?

855
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,516
Well, that depends.

856
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,935
You got maybe a toilet in here?

857
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,020
Yeah, but it's for employees only.

858
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:42,358
I understand, but I thought maybe
you would let me use it anyway.

859
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,901
I'm not so young anymore.

860
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,863
I am, how do you say,
a little incontinent.

861
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,698
Sure, in the back. Through the cooler.

862
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,616
Thank you, sonny boy.

863
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,797
Say, what kind of toilet paper
you got back there?

864
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,884
-The white kind.
-I didn't ask about the color.

865
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,262
I mean is it rough or is it cottony?

866
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,932
-Actually, it's kind of rough.
-Oh, boy.

867
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,227
It's gonna knock the hell
out of my hemorrhoids.

868
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,564
I thought maybe you could let me have
a roll of the soft stuff.

869
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,191
I see you sell the soft stuff back there.

870
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,153
-Yeah, but. . .
-Come on, what's the difference?

871
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,615
You said yourself
you have the rough stuff in the back.

872
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,241
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

873
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,036
Thank you, sonny boy.
You're a lifesaver.

874
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,088
Say, young fella,
I hate to bother you again,

875
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,634
but maybe I could have
something in the back there.

876
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,011
To read? A paper or something.

877
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,846
Sometimes it takes me a while,

878
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,350
and I like to have something to read
while it's going on.

879
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,685
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

880
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,812
One of the magazines
you got in the back over there.

881
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,980
Behind the counter.

882
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,399
-The porno mags?
-Yeah.

883
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,277
I like the cartoons.
They make me laugh.

884
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,114
They draw some of the biggest titties
you ever saw.

885
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,201
No, not this one. Maybe the one
you got underneath this one.

886
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,370
They got bigger titties in there.

887
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,955
Here. Now leave me alone.

888
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,707
Thank you, sonny boy. I appreciate it.

889
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,673
-Hell of a game.
-One ball.

890
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,799
I close the store.

891
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,842
They come all the way here
for one ball.

892
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,970
Hockey's hockey.
At least we got to play.

893
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,014
Twelve minutes is not a game.
Jesus, it's hardly even a warm up.

894
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,308
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
You want something to drink?

895
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,893
Yeah, Gatorade.

896
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,729
Hey, what happened
to all the Gatorade?

897
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,148
Exactly. They drank it all.

898
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,611
-You know what Sanford told me?
-I can't believe Caitlin's getting married.

899
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,321
-Julie Dwyer died.
-Yeah, right.

900
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,782
-No, I'm serious.
-Oh, my God.

901
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,451
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

902
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,704
-How, when?
-Embolism in her brain, yesterday.

903
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,830
Jesus.

904
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,458
She was swimming when it happened.
She died in mid-backstroke.

905
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,169
I haven't seen her in, like, two years.

906
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,047
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but wasn't she one of the illustrious 1 2?

907
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,676
-Yeah, number six.
-You've had sex with a dead person.

908
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,720
-I'm gonna go to her wake.
-No, you're not.

909
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,138
-Why not?
-It's today.

910
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,681
-What?
-Paulson's Funeral Parlor.

911
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,183
-The next show is at 4:00.
-Shit, what about tomorrow?

912
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,310
One night only.
She's buried in the morning.

913
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,521
-Watch the store, I gotta go.
-Wait, wait, wait.

914
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,940
Has it ever occurred to you
that I might be bereaved as well?

915
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,191
You hardly knew her.

916
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,610
True, but do you know
how many people are gonna be there?

917
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,655
-All of our old classmates.
-Stop it, this is beneath even you.

918
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,198
I'm not gonna miss
what's probably gonna be

919
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,992
the social event of the season.

920
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,161
-You hate people.
-But I love gatherings.

921
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,538
-Isn't it ironic?
-Stop it. Stop being an asshole.

922
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,999
-Someone's gotta watch the store.
-If you go, I go.

923
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,375
She meant nothing to you.

924
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,753
She meant nothing to you neither
until I told you she died.

925
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,796
-I'm not taking you.
-I'm going with you.

926
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,048
I can't close the store.

927
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,341
You just closed the store
to play hockey on the roof.

928
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,552
Exactly, which means
I can't close it for another hour

929
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,471
so we can both go to a wake.

930
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,723
You were saying?

931
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,600
Thanks for putting me
in such a tough spot.

932
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,518
You're a good friend.

933
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,607
-She was pretty young, huh?
-Twenty-two, just like us.

934
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,444
-Embolism in a pool.
-What an embarrassing way to die.

935
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,863
That's nothing compared
to how my cousin Walter died.

936
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,741
-How did he die?
-He broke his neck.

937
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,242
That's embarrassing?

938
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,995
He broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick.

939
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,247
-Shut the hell up.
-I swear.

940
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,249
-Stop it.
-Bible truth.

941
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,751
Oh, my God.

942
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,587
Come on, haven't you ever tried
to suck your own dick?

943
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,214
-No.
-Yeah, right.

944
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,590
You're so repressed.

945
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,300
Because I never tried
to suck my own dick?

946
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,760
No, because you won't admit to it.

947
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:41,263
As if a guy's a fucking pervert because
he tries to get down on himself.

948
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,266
You're as curious as the rest of us, pal.
You've tried it.

949
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,726
Who found him?

950
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,269
My cousin? My aunt found him.

951
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,063
It was a mess. He was on his bed.

952
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,441
His legs doubled over on himself.
Mom freaked out.

953
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,614
-He made it, huh? A dick in his mouth.
-Yeah.

954
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,742
Balls resting on his lips.

955
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,412
-Wow, he really made it.
-Yeah, but at what a price.

956
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,127
-I could never reach.
-Reach what?

957
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,088
-You know.
-What, your dick?

958
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,173
Yeah, like you said,
I guess everybody gets curious

959
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,217
and tries it sometime.

960
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,927
I never tried it.

961
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,265
Fucking pervert.

962
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,369
I knew this was a bad idea
to close the store.

963
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,413
-Listen to you.
-I can't help it.

964
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,624
At least when we were on the roof,
I could see if anybody wanted to go in.

965
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,043
Nobody's there. It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

966
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,546
How many people ever come
to the store at 4:00 on a Saturday?

967
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:02,261
Let us in.

968
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:28,124
-I can't fucking believe you.
-I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.

969
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,167
You knocked the casket over,
for Christ's sake.

970
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:32,086
I was just leaning on it.
It was an accident.

971
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,171
Like someone knocks a casket over
on purpose?

972
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:36,090
So the casket fell over. Big deal.

973
01:01:36,174 --> 01:01:38,676
-Her fucking body fell out.
-So they'll put her back in it.

974
01:01:38,802 --> 01:01:40,970
It's not like it matters
if she breaks something.

975
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:43,180
Just go. Just go open the video store.

976
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:46,767
-Yeah, open the video store.
-Shut the fuck up, junkie.

977
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:52,940
-Just go open the video store.
-Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

978
01:01:53,024 --> 01:01:56,152
And how many times have I told you
not to be dealing in front of the store?

979
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:57,987
I'm not dealing, man.
What are you talking about?

980
01:01:58,071 --> 01:02:00,156
-You got anything, man?
-Yeah, man, what you want?

981
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:06,078
-Hey, let me borrow your car.
-I don't wanna talk to you.

982
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:07,746
Fine. Just let me borrow your car.

983
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:11,083
-Why should I loan you my car?
-I wanna rent a movie.

984
01:02:11,168 --> 01:02:13,502
-You wanna rent a movie.
-I wanna rent a movie.

985
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,046
-What's that for?
-You work in a video store.

986
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,048
I work in a shitty video store.

987
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:21,844
I wanna go to a good video store
so I can get a good movie.

988
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,848
And a pack of cigarettes.

989
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:27,516
Cute cat. What is its name?

990
01:02:27,601 --> 01:02:30,477
-Annoying Customer.
-Fucking dickhead.

991
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:36,275
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers sometimes?

992
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:37,484
Let me borrow your car.

993
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:39,528
-May I be blunt with you?
-If you must.

994
01:02:39,613 --> 01:02:41,739
We are employees
of the Quick Stop Convenience

995
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:43,449
and RST Video, respectively.

996
01:02:43,533 --> 01:02:45,618
As such, we have certain obligations.

997
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:47,328
Though they may seem
cruel and unusual,

998
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:49,246
does mean manning the store
until closing.

999
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,457
I see, so playing hockey
and attending wakes,

1000
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,584
these practices
are standard operating procedure?

1001
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:55,461
There's a difference.
Those were obligations.

1002
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:58,005
Obligations that couldn't have been met
at any other date.

1003
01:02:58,089 --> 01:02:59,548
Now, renting videos,
that's just gratuitous,

1004
01:02:59,633 --> 01:03:02,843
not to mention illogical,
being that you work at a video store.

1005
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:04,678
-Are you open?
-Yes.

1006
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:06,931
Know what?
I don't think I care for your rationale.

1007
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:09,642
Well, it's gonna have to do,
being that it's my car up for request.

1008
01:03:09,726 --> 01:03:12,061
-Can I help you?
-A pack of cigarettes.

1009
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:13,354
So, what's your point?

1010
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:15,981
My point is you're a clerk,
paid to do a job.

1011
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:19,026
You can't just do anything you want
while you're working.

1012
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:23,822
"Space alien revealed
as head of Time Warner.

1013
01:03:23,907 --> 01:03:25,908
"Reports stock increase."

1014
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:29,411
They print any kind of shit
in these papers.

1015
01:03:29,496 --> 01:03:30,996
They certainly do, $3.

1016
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:33,415
So your argument is
that title dictates behavior?

1017
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,292
-What?
-You won't let me use your car

1018
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:37,378
because I have a title
and a job description.

1019
01:03:37,462 --> 01:03:40,172
-I'm supposed to follow it, right?
-Exactly.

1020
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:45,761
I saw one, one time that said
the next week the world is ending.

1021
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:47,888
And then in the next week's paper,
they said,

1022
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:51,141
"We were miraculously saved
at the zero hour

1023
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:56,188
"by a koala-fish mutant bird."
Crazy shit.

1024
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,983
So I'm no more responsible
for my decisions here than, say,

1025
01:03:59,109 --> 01:04:00,818
a death-squad soldier in Bosnia?

1026
01:04:00,902 --> 01:04:01,860
Now that's stretching it.

1027
01:04:01,945 --> 01:04:03,862
You're not being asked to slay children.

1028
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:05,364
Yeah, not yet.

1029
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:07,324
And I remember one time. . .

1030
01:04:08,952 --> 01:04:11,620
I'm gonna break your fucking head,
you fucking jerk-off.

1031
01:04:11,705 --> 01:04:13,038
I'm sorry, he meant to hit me.

1032
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:14,373
-Well, he missed.
-Yeah, I know.

1033
01:04:14,457 --> 01:04:17,209
Let me refund your money
and we'll call it even, all right?

1034
01:04:17,294 --> 01:04:19,086
Yeah, I'll never come in here again.

1035
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:23,132
And if I see you again, I'm gonna
break your fucking head open.

1036
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:29,513
-What the fuck did you do that for?
-Two reasons,

1037
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:31,348
one, I hate it
when the people can't shut up

1038
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:33,225
about the stupid tabloid headlines.

1039
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,269
-Oh, Jesus.
-And two, to prove a point.

1040
01:04:35,353 --> 01:04:37,604
-Title does not dictate behavior.
-What?

1041
01:04:37,689 --> 01:04:40,524
If title dictated my behavior,
as a clerk serving the public,

1042
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:42,651
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy.

1043
01:04:42,736 --> 01:04:46,196
But I did, so my point is
that people dictate their own behavior.

1044
01:04:46,281 --> 01:04:47,698
Even though I work in a video store,

1045
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:49,742
I choose to go rent movies
at Big Choice.

1046
01:04:49,826 --> 01:04:51,243
Agreed?

1047
01:04:51,328 --> 01:04:53,370
You're a danger
to both the dead and the living.

1048
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:55,581
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

1049
01:04:55,665 --> 01:04:58,959
-Please, get the hell out of here.
-I know I'm your hero.

1050
01:05:05,008 --> 01:05:07,176
Sounds to me like
somebody needs to hit the gym.

1051
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,302
Excuse me?

1052
01:05:08,386 --> 01:05:11,597
I heard you strain when you picked up
that milk. Could only weigh 7 pounds.

1053
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:13,098
I didn't strain, I sighed.

1054
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:15,434
I don't think so. That was a grunt.

1055
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:19,271
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

1056
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:20,689
I'm a trainer.

1057
01:05:20,774 --> 01:05:23,233
I know what that sound signifies.
You're out of shape.

1058
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:25,652
What are you talking about?
There's no fat on my body.

1059
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:28,947
No fat. No tone, either.
You don't get enough exercise.

1060
01:05:29,032 --> 01:05:30,532
-You open?
-Yes.

1061
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:33,952
-Just the paper.
-Thirty-five.

1062
01:05:34,037 --> 01:05:37,706
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Do you think this guy's out of shape?

1063
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,000
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.

1064
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:42,127
-He is.
-I am not.

1065
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:45,089
-How much can you bench?
-I don't know.

1066
01:05:45,173 --> 01:05:49,718
-I'd say about 60, 70, tops.
-Oh, I know I can bench more than that.

1067
01:05:49,803 --> 01:05:52,679
-Three-fifty, four.
-No way.

1068
01:05:52,764 --> 01:05:54,098
Feel that.

1069
01:05:54,891 --> 01:05:57,810
Hey, that's tight. Solid.

1070
01:05:57,894 --> 01:05:59,478
Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

1071
01:05:59,562 --> 01:06:01,230
Oh, for God's sakes.

1072
01:06:01,314 --> 01:06:02,481
See? You're ashamed.

1073
01:06:02,565 --> 01:06:05,901
You know you're out of shape.
Here, take my card.

1074
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:08,654
I can get you on
an aerobics free-weights program.

1075
01:06:08,738 --> 01:06:10,322
-Are you open?
-Yes.

1076
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:11,824
I'm not out of shape.

1077
01:06:11,908 --> 01:06:13,492
Excuse me,
have you been here all day?

1078
01:06:13,576 --> 01:06:16,537
-Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
-He's got those love handles.

1079
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,330
I don't have love handles.

1080
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:21,041
-Were you working here about 4:00?
-Yes.

1081
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:22,960
It's probably
from being around all this food.

1082
01:06:23,044 --> 01:06:24,044
Oh, I know.

1083
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:27,673
If I had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

1084
01:06:27,757 --> 01:06:29,550
I'm not out of shape.

1085
01:06:29,634 --> 01:06:31,510
-Can I have your name please?
-Dante Hicks.

1086
01:06:31,594 --> 01:06:33,011
Why? What is this all about?

1087
01:06:33,096 --> 01:06:34,680
You're Dante Hicks?

1088
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:37,099
Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

1089
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,643
-Because he's out of shape.
-Do I know you?

1090
01:06:39,727 --> 01:06:42,396
Yeah, do you remember Alyssa Jones?
She used to hang out with. . .

1091
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,273
-Caitlin Bree.
-I'm her sister.

1092
01:06:44,357 --> 01:06:46,316
-You're Alyssa's sister, Heather?
-Yes.

1093
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:48,944
-Did you say Caitlin Bree?
-Yeah.

1094
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:51,905
Pretty girl, little taller than her.

1095
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,699
-Gorgeous body?
-Yeah.

1096
01:06:53,783 --> 01:06:55,033
And you're Dante Hicks?

1097
01:06:55,118 --> 01:06:57,286
You went to the same school.
You played hockey.

1098
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,746
-Yeah, how did you know that?
-You still going out with her?

1099
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:01,206
No, she's getting married.

1100
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:04,042
-To you?
-No, to an Asian design major.

1101
01:07:04,127 --> 01:07:05,461
Oh, shit.

1102
01:07:06,337 --> 01:07:09,673
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I used to fuck her.

1103
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:12,050
-What?
-Yeah, about two, three years ago.

1104
01:07:12,135 --> 01:07:14,887
While you two were dating,
I drove a black Trans Am.

1105
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:17,097
-You're Rick Derris?
-Yeah.

1106
01:07:17,182 --> 01:07:19,099
-You know him?
-Yeah.

1107
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:21,977
-Caitlin talked about him all the time.
-Really?

1108
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:25,772
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?

1109
01:07:25,857 --> 01:07:28,525
Man, don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

1110
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,903
I'm surprised
you didn't know about it, Dante.

1111
01:07:30,987 --> 01:07:33,739
Everybody in school knew about it,
even in my class.

1112
01:07:33,823 --> 01:07:36,575
Jesus Christ, what next?

1113
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:37,910
-Here you go.
-What's this?

1114
01:07:37,994 --> 01:07:39,745
-It's a fine for $500.
-What?

1115
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:41,330
Five hundred bucks? For what?

1116
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:46,418
For violation of New Jersey Statute
Section 2A, number 1 70/51 .

1117
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:49,546
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco

1118
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,716
or tobacco-related products
to persons under the age of 1 8

1119
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,092
is regarded as disorderly.

1120
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:55,802
What are you talking about?

1121
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:58,472
An angry mother called
the state division of taxation

1122
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:00,516
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee

1123
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,685
sold her 4-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes at 4:00 today.

1124
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:06,355
The New Jersey division of taxation
called the Board of Health

1125
01:08:06,439 --> 01:08:08,607
and sent me down to issue a fine.

1126
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:10,484
You claimed
you were working here all day,

1127
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:12,194
hence the fine is yours.

1128
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:15,030
The fine is doubled due
to the incredibly young age of the child.

1129
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:17,199
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids.

1130
01:08:17,283 --> 01:08:20,327
You sold cigarettes to a 4-year-old?
What a scumbag.

1131
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:21,828
That's sick, Dante.

1132
01:08:21,913 --> 01:08:24,748
I didn't sell any cigarettes to any kids.
I swear.

1133
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,250
The due date is on the bottom.

1134
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:29,294
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

1135
01:08:29,379 --> 01:08:31,505
Failure to remit before the due date

1136
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:33,465
will result in a charge
of criminal negligence

1137
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,384
and a warrant will be issued
for your arrest.

1138
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:36,760
Have a nice day.

1139
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:40,472
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids. Hey, wait a minute.

1140
01:08:41,975 --> 01:08:43,058
Forget it.

1141
01:08:43,226 --> 01:08:46,395
I don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to 4-year-olds.

1142
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,982
-Can I give you a lift somewhere?
-Sure.

1143
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:53,151
-How about the beach?
-I like the way you think.

1144
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:00,284
Jesus, what next?

1145
01:09:00,451 --> 01:09:02,494
-Dante?
-What?

1146
01:09:02,662 --> 01:09:03,870
Caitlin?

1147
01:09:26,519 --> 01:09:28,604
-When did you get home?
-Just now.

1148
01:09:28,688 --> 01:09:30,647
I can't believe it. I haven't seen you. . .

1149
01:09:33,943 --> 01:09:35,777
Dante, you have a customer.

1150
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,491
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside.

1151
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:44,411
-She was with Rick Derris.
-Let's not talk about that.

1152
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:47,748
-How did you get home?
-Train, it took eight hours.

1153
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:48,915
I can't believe you're here.

1154
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,959
-Excuse me. . .
-Yeah, back behind the oil.

1155
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,794
-How long are you staying?
-Until Monday.

1156
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:54,963
Then I have to take the train back.

1157
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:56,131
Pack of cigarettes.

1158
01:09:56,215 --> 01:09:57,299
Hey, congratulations.

1159
01:09:57,383 --> 01:09:59,092
I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

1160
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:01,970
-She's marrying an Asian design major.
-So I'm told.

1161
01:10:32,794 --> 01:10:34,336
You're just gonna close the store?

1162
01:10:34,462 --> 01:10:36,672
I wanna talk to you
and I don't wanna be disturbed.

1163
01:10:36,756 --> 01:10:39,091
There's something
I read in the tabloids.

1164
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:41,426
-You saw it?
-Very dramatic, I thought.

1165
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:43,428
-It's not what you think.
-It's not what I think.

1166
01:10:43,513 --> 01:10:46,139
It's worse? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child?

1167
01:10:46,224 --> 01:10:48,433
-What's going on here?
-I am not pregnant.

1168
01:10:48,518 --> 01:10:50,644
Were you gonna tell me
or just send me an invitation?

1169
01:10:50,728 --> 01:10:51,770
I was gonna tell you,

1170
01:10:51,854 --> 01:10:54,106
but we were getting along,
I didn't want to mess it up.

1171
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:57,234
You could've broken it to me gently
by telling me you had a boyfriend.

1172
01:10:57,318 --> 01:11:00,278
-I mean I told you I have a girlfriend.
-I know, I'm sorry.

1173
01:11:00,363 --> 01:11:03,240
But when we started talking,
it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.

1174
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:04,825
And he proposed last month.

1175
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:07,536
-And you said yes?
-Well, kind of, sort of.

1176
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,455
Is that what they teach in that
school of yours? Kind of, sort of?

1177
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:13,333
Everyone knows about this except me.
Do you know how humiliating that is?

1178
01:11:13,418 --> 01:11:16,378
I would've told you, and
you would have stopped calling me.

1179
01:11:16,462 --> 01:11:18,463
-How do you know that?
-Because I know you.

1180
01:11:18,548 --> 01:11:21,633
You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

1181
01:11:21,718 --> 01:11:24,010
-So you're really getting married?
-No.

1182
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:26,138
You're not really getting married?

1183
01:11:26,222 --> 01:11:27,723
The story goes like this,

1184
01:11:27,807 --> 01:11:30,600
he proposed to me,
I told him I had to think about it,

1185
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:32,561
and he insisted I wear the ring anyway.

1186
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:34,980
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

1187
01:11:35,064 --> 01:11:36,398
How like her.

1188
01:11:36,482 --> 01:11:37,691
Then my mother called me this morning

1189
01:11:37,775 --> 01:11:40,026
to let me know that
the announcement was in the paper.

1190
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:41,903
That's when I hopped the train
to come back.

1191
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,321
I knew you'd be a wreck.

1192
01:11:43,406 --> 01:11:46,283
-Thanks for the vote of confidence.
-Was I right?

1193
01:11:46,367 --> 01:11:48,160
Wreck is a harsh term.

1194
01:11:48,244 --> 01:11:50,579
Disturbed is more like it.
Mildly disturbed, even.

1195
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:54,166
I love a macho facade.
It is such a turn-on.

1196
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,333
What smells like shoe polish?

1197
01:11:55,418 --> 01:11:57,878
So you came here to what,
to comfort me?

1198
01:11:57,962 --> 01:12:00,839
The last thing I needed was for you
to think I was hiding something.

1199
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:02,591
-But you were.
-No, I wasn't.

1200
01:12:02,675 --> 01:12:05,051
Not really.
I told you I'd been seeing other people.

1201
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:06,261
Yeah, but not seriously.

1202
01:12:06,345 --> 01:12:07,929
Christ, you're ready
to walk down the aisle.

1203
01:12:08,014 --> 01:12:10,348
That constitutes something more
than just seeing somebody.

1204
01:12:10,433 --> 01:12:13,727
-I mean, what's going on?
-I'm giving him his ring back.

1205
01:12:13,811 --> 01:12:15,061
What?

1206
01:12:15,146 --> 01:12:17,898
I don't wanna marry him.
I don't wanna get married now.

1207
01:12:17,982 --> 01:12:20,692
I'm on the verge of graduation.
I want to go to grad school after this.

1208
01:12:20,777 --> 01:12:22,694
And then I wanna start a career.

1209
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:23,862
I don't wanna be a wife first,

1210
01:12:23,946 --> 01:12:26,782
and then worry about when I'm gonna
fit in all of the other stuff.

1211
01:12:26,866 --> 01:12:29,201
I've come way too far
and studied too damn hard

1212
01:12:29,285 --> 01:12:32,329
to let my education go to waste
as a housewife.

1213
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,664
And I know that's what I'd become.

1214
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:36,124
Sang's just signed with a major firm,

1215
01:12:36,209 --> 01:12:38,543
and he's gonna be pulling in
a huge salary,

1216
01:12:38,628 --> 01:12:41,963
which would give me
no reason to work. He's very traditional.

1217
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:44,716
Wait a minute, his name is Sang?
Past tense?

1218
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:46,384
Stop it. He's a nice guy.

1219
01:12:46,469 --> 01:12:49,012
Well, if he's so nice,
why aren't you marrying him?

1220
01:12:49,096 --> 01:12:50,639
I just told you.

1221
01:12:50,723 --> 01:12:52,974
There's more to this, isn't there?

1222
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,560
Why, Mr. Hicks,
whatever do you mean?

1223
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:57,020
I don't have something to do with it?

1224
01:12:57,104 --> 01:12:59,022
-You have nothing to do with it.
-Oh, you lie.

1225
01:12:59,106 --> 01:13:00,524
Look how full of yourself you are.

1226
01:13:00,608 --> 01:13:02,359
I believe in giving credit
where credit's due.

1227
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:05,028
And I believe I'm the impetus
behind your refusal to wed.

1228
01:13:05,112 --> 01:13:06,696
If I'm so nuts about you,

1229
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:09,574
then why am I having sex
with an Asian design major?

1230
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,535
Jesus, you're so caustic.

1231
01:13:11,661 --> 01:13:14,246
I had to knock you down
from that cloud you were floating on.

1232
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:16,414
When I say I don't wanna get married,
I mean just that.

1233
01:13:16,499 --> 01:13:19,709
I don't want to marry anybody.
Not for years.

1234
01:13:19,836 --> 01:13:22,003
Who's asking?
I don't wanna marry you.

1235
01:13:22,088 --> 01:13:24,673
Good. Keep in that frame of mind.

1236
01:13:24,757 --> 01:13:25,924
Well, let's date.

1237
01:13:26,008 --> 01:13:29,719
Oh, I think Sang and Veronica,
they'd love that.

1238
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:32,180
We can introduce the two of them.
They may hit it off.

1239
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:34,432
You're serious. You wanna date again.

1240
01:13:34,517 --> 01:13:36,268
I wanna be your boyfriend, yes.

1241
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:38,687
It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years.

1242
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:41,731
-Believe me, you'll get over it.
-Give me a bit more credit.

1243
01:13:41,816 --> 01:13:43,608
I think it's time we got back together.

1244
01:13:43,693 --> 01:13:45,944
I mean, I'm more mature,
you're more mature,

1245
01:13:46,028 --> 01:13:48,154
you're finishing college,
I'm already in the job market.

1246
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,240
-You work in a market, all right.
-Cute.

1247
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:53,451
Tell me you wouldn't wanna go out
after the talking we've been doing.

1248
01:13:53,536 --> 01:13:55,453
The key word here is talk, Dante.

1249
01:13:55,538 --> 01:13:58,039
I think the idea,
or the conception of us dating

1250
01:13:58,124 --> 01:14:01,209
is a lot more idyllic than what
actually happens when we date.

1251
01:14:01,294 --> 01:14:04,421
So, what, are we supposed to
pretend over the phone we're dating?

1252
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:06,798
I don't know, maybe we should just see
what happens.

1253
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:09,217
-Let me take you out tonight.
-On a date?

1254
01:14:09,302 --> 01:14:11,970
Yeah, a real date. Dinner and a movie.

1255
01:14:12,388 --> 01:14:14,139
The Dante Hicks
dinner-and-movie date.

1256
01:14:14,223 --> 01:14:18,476
-I think I've been on that one before.
-You have a better suggestion?

1257
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,730
How about
the Caitlin Bree walk-on-the-boardwalk

1258
01:14:21,814 --> 01:14:24,441
then-get-naked-somewhere
kind-of-private date?

1259
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:26,985
-I hear that's kind of a popular date.
-Jerk.

1260
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:30,488
God, here I am, throwing myself at you,
succumbing to your wily charms,

1261
01:14:30,573 --> 01:14:32,949
and you're calling me a slut,
in so many words.

1262
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:34,451
-What about Sing?
-Sang.

1263
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:36,661
-Sang.
-He's not invited.

1264
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:38,079
He's your fiance.

1265
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:41,124
I'm offering you my body
and you're offering me semantics.

1266
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,293
He's just a boyfriend, Dante.

1267
01:14:43,377 --> 01:14:44,711
And in case you haven't gotten the drift

1268
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:48,089
of why I came
all the way here from Ohio,

1269
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:50,634
I'm about to become single again.

1270
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:53,511
And yes, allow me to placate your ego,

1271
01:14:53,596 --> 01:14:56,598
you are the inspiration for this bold
and momentous decision

1272
01:14:56,682 --> 01:14:59,768
that will probably get me ostracized
from both school and home.

1273
01:14:59,852 --> 01:15:03,438
You ask me who I choose,
I choose you.

1274
01:15:04,857 --> 01:15:07,442
-So, what are you saying?
-You're such an asshole.

1275
01:15:07,526 --> 01:15:08,693
Just kidding.

1276
01:15:08,778 --> 01:15:11,029
I can already see
this is not gonna work out.

1277
01:15:11,113 --> 01:15:13,323
I'll ask Randal to close up
when he gets back.

1278
01:15:13,407 --> 01:15:14,491
Where is he anyway?

1279
01:15:14,575 --> 01:15:16,534
I thought he'd be at your side,
like a lapdog.

1280
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:18,662
He went to go rent a movie,
he isn't back yet.

1281
01:15:18,746 --> 01:15:20,538
Screw it,
I'll close up and leave him a note.

1282
01:15:20,623 --> 01:15:22,374
You're too responsible.

1283
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,709
But no. I have to go home first.

1284
01:15:24,794 --> 01:15:26,878
They don't even know
I've left school yet.

1285
01:15:26,963 --> 01:15:29,047
And I should break
the disengagement news to my mother,

1286
01:15:29,131 --> 01:15:32,634
which is gonna cause quite a row,
considering she loves Sang.

1287
01:15:32,718 --> 01:15:34,135
Who doesn't?

1288
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,137
Well, me, I guess.

1289
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:40,767
So I shall take my leave of you,
but I will return in a little while,

1290
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:44,354
at which time, yes, I would love to go
for dinner and a movie with you.

1291
01:15:44,438 --> 01:15:46,815
Hey, what happened to the walk
and the nakedness?

1292
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:50,485
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.
See you later, handsome.

1293
01:15:56,951 --> 01:15:57,993
Yes.

1294
01:16:16,303 --> 01:16:18,888
-Get to work.
-Hey, what did you rent?

1295
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:22,934
-"Best of Both Worlds"?
-Hermaphroditic porn.

1296
01:16:23,019 --> 01:16:25,395
Starlets with both organs.
You should see the box.

1297
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:27,605
Beautiful chicks with dicks
that put mine to shame.

1298
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,108
-And you rented this?
-Hey, I like to expand my horizons.

1299
01:16:30,192 --> 01:16:32,027
I got fined
for selling cigarettes to a minor.

1300
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:34,029
-No way.
-Five hundred dollars.

1301
01:16:34,113 --> 01:16:36,531
-You're bullshitting.
-No, I'm not.

1302
01:16:39,368 --> 01:16:41,494
Holy shit,
I didn't even think they enforced this.

1303
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:42,704
Living proof.

1304
01:16:42,788 --> 01:16:44,205
You never sold cigarettes to kids.

1305
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:46,416
-I didn't, you did.
-Really?

1306
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,668
Yep. Little girl, maybe 4 years old?

1307
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:50,253
Holy shit, that girl?

1308
01:16:50,337 --> 01:16:52,130
As opposed
to the hundreds of other children

1309
01:16:52,214 --> 01:16:53,715
you've sold cigarettes
while working here.

1310
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:56,051
-Then how come you got the fine?
-Because I'm here.

1311
01:16:56,135 --> 01:16:57,927
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

1312
01:16:58,012 --> 01:16:59,471
Then why aren't you screaming at me?

1313
01:16:59,555 --> 01:17:01,014
-Because I'm happy.
-You're happy?

1314
01:17:01,098 --> 01:17:02,599
-I'm happy.
-You're happy to get a fine?

1315
01:17:02,683 --> 01:17:05,643
-I'm happy because Caitlin came.
-I know you're lying.

1316
01:17:05,728 --> 01:17:07,729
-I'm not, she just left.
-What did she say?

1317
01:17:07,813 --> 01:17:10,231
She said she's not marrying that guy.
She went home to tell her mom.

1318
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:12,317
-You're kidding.
-I'm not.

1319
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:14,611
Wow, you've had quite an evening.

1320
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:17,072
She went home and
she's getting ready. We're going out.

1321
01:17:17,156 --> 01:17:19,574
I feel so ineffectual.
Is there anything I can do for you?

1322
01:17:19,658 --> 01:17:21,326
Watch the store while I go and change.

1323
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,911
What happened
to title dictates behavior?

1324
01:17:22,995 --> 01:17:26,122
Well, this is my way
of spitting water at life.

1325
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:28,792
All right, you want me to bring
the VCR over so we can watch this?

1326
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:31,127
No, I might be leaving early.

1327
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:32,754
You're gonna have to lock up
the store tonight.

1328
01:17:32,838 --> 01:17:35,507
All right, but you're missing out.
Chicks with dicks.

1329
01:18:05,037 --> 01:18:06,704
No.

1330
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:12,085
Well, Randal Graves,
scourge of the video renter.

1331
01:18:12,169 --> 01:18:13,545
Ladies and gentlemen,

1332
01:18:13,629 --> 01:18:16,548
Ms. Asian Design Major herself,
Caitlin Bree.

1333
01:18:16,632 --> 01:18:19,050
You saw that article?
God, isn't it awful?

1334
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,719
-My mother sent that in.
-I take it she likes the guy.

1335
01:18:21,804 --> 01:18:24,222
You'd think she's marrying him.

1336
01:18:24,306 --> 01:18:27,058
-What are you watching?
-Children's programing.

1337
01:18:27,143 --> 01:18:29,727
What did your mom say when
you told her you weren't engaged?

1338
01:18:29,812 --> 01:18:32,564
She said not to come home
until after graduation.

1339
01:18:32,648 --> 01:18:34,732
Wow, you got thrown out for Dante?

1340
01:18:34,817 --> 01:18:37,402
What can I say?
He does weird things to me.

1341
01:18:37,486 --> 01:18:39,571
-Can I watch?
-You can hold me down.

1342
01:18:39,655 --> 01:18:41,197
Can I join in?

1343
01:18:41,282 --> 01:18:43,533
You might be let down.
I'm not a hermaphrodite.

1344
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:44,909
Hey, few are.

1345
01:18:44,994 --> 01:18:47,078
So, what makes you think you can
maintain a relationship with him

1346
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:48,913
this time around?

1347
01:18:48,998 --> 01:18:50,498
A woman's intuition.

1348
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:54,836
Something inside me says it's time
to give the old boy a serious try.

1349
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:57,547
Hey, you know, you and I
have something in common.

1350
01:18:57,631 --> 01:18:59,215
We both eat Chinese.

1351
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,009
-Dick.
-Exactly.

1352
01:19:01,093 --> 01:19:02,260
So where is he?

1353
01:19:02,344 --> 01:19:04,262
He went home
to change for the big date.

1354
01:19:04,346 --> 01:19:08,016
-God, isn't he great?
-No, this is great.

1355
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:10,268
Oh, Lord. Can I use your bathroom?

1356
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:12,770
-There's no light back there.
-Why aren't there any lights?

1357
01:19:12,855 --> 01:19:16,232
Well, there are, but for some reason,
they stop working at 5: 1 4 every night.

1358
01:19:16,317 --> 01:19:18,318
-You're kidding.
-Nobody can figure it out.

1359
01:19:18,402 --> 01:19:20,445
The boss doesn't wanna pay
the electrician to fix it,

1360
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:22,947
because the electrician owes money
to the video store.

1361
01:19:23,032 --> 01:19:24,949
Such a sordid state of affairs.

1362
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:28,119
And I'm caught in the middle,
torn between my loyalty for the boss

1363
01:19:28,204 --> 01:19:30,955
and my desire to piss with the lights on.

1364
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,790
I'll try to manage.

1365
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,250
Oh, hey, Caitlin.

1366
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:36,711
Break his heart again this time,
and I'll kill you.

1367
01:19:36,795 --> 01:19:38,504
Nothing personal.

1368
01:19:38,589 --> 01:19:41,716
You are very protective of him, Randal.
You always have been.

1369
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,427
Territoriality, he was mine first.

1370
01:19:44,553 --> 01:19:46,679
Oh, that was so cute.

1371
01:19:59,735 --> 01:20:03,071
-Who eats cock?
-A bunch of savages in this town.

1372
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:04,280
Hey, Caitlin's in the back.

1373
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,366
Check on her,
she's been back there a long time.

1374
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,743
-There are no lights back there.
-I told her that.

1375
01:20:08,827 --> 01:20:11,162
She said she didn't need any.

1376
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:13,998
Why don't you go join her?
Make a little bathroom bam-bam.

1377
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,292
I love your sexy talk.
It's so kindergarten.

1378
01:20:16,377 --> 01:20:18,544
-Poo-poo, wee-wee.
-Fuck you.

1379
01:20:32,559 --> 01:20:36,104
-How did you get here so fast?
-I left like an hour ago.

1380
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:40,483
Do you always talk this weird
after you violate a woman?

1381
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:42,819
Maybe the Asian design major
slipped her some opium.

1382
01:20:42,903 --> 01:20:44,279
Could be.

1383
01:20:44,446 --> 01:20:48,032
-It has never been like that before.
-Like what?

1384
01:20:49,076 --> 01:20:52,787
When you just lay perfectly still
and let me do everything.

1385
01:20:53,122 --> 01:20:55,623
-Am I missing something here?
-Okay.

1386
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:58,835
I went back there,
and Dante was already waiting for me.

1387
01:20:58,919 --> 01:21:00,420
He was?

1388
01:21:00,629 --> 01:21:03,381
It was so cool. He didn't say a word.

1389
01:21:03,549 --> 01:21:05,258
He didn't have to.

1390
01:21:07,136 --> 01:21:08,511
He was just ready, you know?

1391
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:11,264
And, like, we didn't kiss
or talk or anything.

1392
01:21:11,348 --> 01:21:13,349
He just sat there
and let me do all the work.

1393
01:21:13,434 --> 01:21:15,977
You dog.
I didn't even see you go back there.

1394
01:21:16,061 --> 01:21:19,564
And the fact that there weren't
any lights on made it so. . .

1395
01:21:19,732 --> 01:21:21,649
God, that was so great.

1396
01:21:22,151 --> 01:21:24,152
My legs are still shaking.

1397
01:21:25,612 --> 01:21:27,113
It wasn't me.

1398
01:21:28,073 --> 01:21:30,575
Yeah, right. Who was it then, Randal?

1399
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,577
-Was it you?
-No, I was up here the whole time.

1400
01:21:32,661 --> 01:21:35,538
-You two better quit it.
-I'm serious.

1401
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:38,499
Oh, so we didn't just have sex
in the bathroom?

1402
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:39,667
No.

1403
01:21:43,672 --> 01:21:45,631
Stop it, this isn't funny.

1404
01:21:45,716 --> 01:21:48,593
I'm not fooling around.
I just came in from outside.

1405
01:21:48,677 --> 01:21:51,137
-This isn't fucking funny, Dante.
-I'm not kidding.

1406
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:53,264
-Who went back there?
-Nobody, I swear.

1407
01:21:53,349 --> 01:21:54,432
I feel nauseous.

1408
01:21:54,516 --> 01:21:55,808
Are you sure
there was someone there?

1409
01:21:55,893 --> 01:21:58,478
Well, I didn't just fuck myself.
Jesus Christ.

1410
01:21:58,562 --> 01:21:59,687
God, I'm gonna be sick.

1411
01:21:59,772 --> 01:22:02,565
-You just fucked a total stranger?
-Shut the fuck up.

1412
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:04,275
-Call the police.
-No, don't.

1413
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,611
There's a stranger in our bathroom
and he just raped Caitlin.

1414
01:22:06,695 --> 01:22:09,405
-She said she did all the work.
-Would you shut the fuck up?

1415
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,824
Who the fuck is in our bathroom?

1416
01:22:13,702 --> 01:22:15,787
-Who is he?
-I don't know.

1417
01:22:15,871 --> 01:22:18,289
He just came in
and asked to use the bathroom.

1418
01:22:18,374 --> 01:22:20,083
-What time was this?
-I don't know.

1419
01:22:20,167 --> 01:22:24,045
-What time did hockey end?
-Like 3:00, 3:30.

1420
01:22:24,129 --> 01:22:25,963
And what time did we get back
from the funeral?

1421
01:22:26,048 --> 01:22:28,341
-4:00, I think.
-Wait, who was working here?

1422
01:22:28,425 --> 01:22:29,675
Just me.

1423
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,303
I thought you said you went
to play hockey and went to a funeral.

1424
01:22:32,388 --> 01:22:33,471
Yeah, we did.

1425
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:35,098
Well, then
who was operating the store?

1426
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:38,267
-Nobody, it was closed.
-With this guy locked in here?

1427
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:41,604
Well, everything happened so quickly,
I guess I forgot he was back there.

1428
01:22:41,688 --> 01:22:43,898
-Can we take it now?
-Go ahead.

1429
01:22:49,988 --> 01:22:52,323
Was he alive when Caitlin. . .

1430
01:22:52,408 --> 01:22:54,700
No, I place the time of death
at about 3:20.

1431
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:57,328
Then how could she, you know?

1432
01:22:57,663 --> 01:22:59,747
The body can maintain an erection
after expiration.

1433
01:22:59,832 --> 01:23:01,207
Sometimes for hours.

1434
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:03,042
Did he have the magazine
when he came in?

1435
01:23:03,127 --> 01:23:05,002
No, I gave it to him.

1436
01:23:05,879 --> 01:23:07,630
He asked me for it.

1437
01:23:08,132 --> 01:23:10,049
I can't say
until we get him back to the lab,

1438
01:23:10,134 --> 01:23:13,177
but my guess is he was masturbating,
his heart seized and he died.

1439
01:23:13,262 --> 01:23:15,596
That's when the girl found him.

1440
01:23:15,681 --> 01:23:17,181
Something smells like shoe polish.

1441
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:20,017
This has gotta be the weirdest thing
you've ever been called in on.

1442
01:23:20,102 --> 01:23:22,395
Actually, I once had to tag a kid
that broke his neck

1443
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,106
trying to put his mouth on his penis.

1444
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:27,191
What about Caitlin?

1445
01:23:27,276 --> 01:23:30,153
Shock trauma, she's gonna need
years of therapy after this.

1446
01:23:30,237 --> 01:23:33,990
My question is, how did she come
to have sex with the dead man?

1447
01:23:34,074 --> 01:23:35,950
She thought it was me.

1448
01:23:36,493 --> 01:23:39,579
What kind of convenience store
do you run here?

1449
01:24:06,982 --> 01:24:08,274
Salsa shark.

1450
01:24:08,358 --> 01:24:10,651
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

1451
01:24:12,488 --> 01:24:15,740
Man goes into cage,
cage goes into salsa,

1452
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:18,242
shark's in the salsa, our shark.

1453
01:24:19,578 --> 01:24:21,245
Oh, what? What's with you, man?

1454
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,080
You haven't said anything
for like 20 minutes.

1455
01:24:23,165 --> 01:24:24,916
What the hell's your problem?

1456
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,876
-This life.
-This life?

1457
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,045
Why do I have this life?

1458
01:24:29,129 --> 01:24:31,005
Have some chips, you'll feel better.

1459
01:24:31,089 --> 01:24:34,800
I'm stuck in this pit,
working for less than slave wages,

1460
01:24:34,885 --> 01:24:38,804
working on my day off,
the goddamn steel shutters are closed,

1461
01:24:39,139 --> 01:24:43,559
I deal with every backward-ass fuck
on the planet, I smell like shoe polish,

1462
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:46,979
my ex-girlfriend is catatonic
after fucking a dead guy,

1463
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:50,024
and my present girlfriend
has sucked 36 dicks.

1464
01:24:50,108 --> 01:24:51,275
Thirty-seven.

1465
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,402
My life is in the shitter right now
and if you don't mind,

1466
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:54,862
I'd like to stew a bit.

1467
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:56,572
-You open?
-Yeah.

1468
01:24:59,243 --> 01:25:00,535
That's all bullshit, man.

1469
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:02,119
You know what
the real problem here is?

1470
01:25:02,204 --> 01:25:03,496
I was born.

1471
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,541
-You should shit or get off the pot.
-I should shit or get off the pot.

1472
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:09,377
-You should shit or get off the pot.
-What the hell are you talking about?

1473
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:12,838
I'm talking about this inability
to improve your station in life.

1474
01:25:12,923 --> 01:25:14,298
-Fuck you.
-It's true, man.

1475
01:25:14,383 --> 01:25:16,968
You sit there and blame life
for dealing you a cruddy hand,

1476
01:25:17,052 --> 01:25:20,304
never once accepting the responsibility
for the way your situation is.

1477
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:21,639
What responsibility?

1478
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:23,808
All right,
if you hate this job and the people,

1479
01:25:23,892 --> 01:25:26,644
and the fact that you have to come in
on your day off, why don't you quit?

1480
01:25:26,728 --> 01:25:29,647
-Well, like it's that easy.
-It is, you just up and quit.

1481
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:32,066
There's other jobs.
They pay better money.

1482
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,443
You're bound to be qualified
for at least one of them.

1483
01:25:34,528 --> 01:25:36,404
-So, what's stopping you?
-Leave me alone.

1484
01:25:36,488 --> 01:25:37,822
Oh, you're comfortable, right?

1485
01:25:37,906 --> 01:25:40,324
This is a life of convenience for you.
Any attempt to change it

1486
01:25:40,409 --> 01:25:43,828
would shatter the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

1487
01:25:43,912 --> 01:25:45,371
Like your life's any better?

1488
01:25:45,455 --> 01:25:47,498
Hey, I'm satisfied
with my situation for now.

1489
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:48,833
You don't hear me complaining.

1490
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,085
You, on the other hand,
have been bitching all day.

1491
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:53,004
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

1492
01:25:53,088 --> 01:25:55,256
-It's the same with Veronica.
-Leave her out of this.

1493
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,174
You date Veronica
because it's convenient,

1494
01:25:57,259 --> 01:25:58,551
and she's low maintenance.

1495
01:25:58,635 --> 01:26:01,012
But meanwhile, all you ever do
is talk about Caitlin.

1496
01:26:01,096 --> 01:26:03,347
You carry a torch for a girl
you dated in high school.

1497
01:26:03,432 --> 01:26:05,641
In high school, for God's sake.
You're 22.

1498
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:06,767
Leave me alone.

1499
01:26:06,852 --> 01:26:10,104
If you want Caitlin, then talk to Veronica
and be with Caitlin.

1500
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,189
If you want Veronica,
then be with Veronica.

1501
01:26:12,274 --> 01:26:14,525
But don't pine for one
and fuck the other.

1502
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:17,945
-If you weren't such a fucking coward. . .
-If I wasn't such a fucking coward.

1503
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:21,574
It must be so great to have this ability
to simplify things the way you do.

1504
01:26:21,658 --> 01:26:23,701
-Am I right or what?
-You're wrong.

1505
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:25,328
Things happened today, all right?

1506
01:26:25,412 --> 01:26:27,371
Things that probably
ruined my chances with Caitlin.

1507
01:26:27,456 --> 01:26:28,873
Oh, what? The dead guy?

1508
01:26:28,957 --> 01:26:30,750
She'll get over fucking a dead guy.

1509
01:26:30,834 --> 01:26:33,628
Shit, my mom's been
fucking a dead guy for 30 years.

1510
01:26:33,712 --> 01:26:34,754
I call him "Dad."

1511
01:26:34,838 --> 01:26:37,214
Caitlin and I can't be together.
It's impossible.

1512
01:26:37,299 --> 01:26:38,507
Melodrama coming from you

1513
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,551
seems about as natural
as an oral bowel movement.

1514
01:26:40,636 --> 01:26:42,053
What do you want me to say,

1515
01:26:42,137 --> 01:26:43,888
some of the things
you're saying are true?

1516
01:26:43,972 --> 01:26:46,057
That's the way things are,
they're not gonna change.

1517
01:26:46,141 --> 01:26:48,893
-Make them change.
-I can't, all right?

1518
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:50,353
Jesus, will you leave me alone?

1519
01:26:50,437 --> 01:26:52,313
I can't make changes in my life
like that.

1520
01:26:52,397 --> 01:26:53,731
If I could, I would.

1521
01:26:53,815 --> 01:26:56,525
But I don't have the ability
to risk the comfortable situations

1522
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:58,653
on the big money
and the fabulous prizes.

1523
01:26:58,737 --> 01:27:00,112
Who you kidding? You can so.

1524
01:27:00,197 --> 01:27:02,323
Jesus H . Christ, I can't.

1525
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:03,949
You're gonna sit there
and be miserable,

1526
01:27:04,034 --> 01:27:07,078
because you don't have the guts
to face change?

1527
01:27:07,162 --> 01:27:10,581
My mother told me once
that when I was 3 years old,

1528
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,583
my potty lid was closed.

1529
01:27:12,668 --> 01:27:15,628
And instead of me lifting it,
I shit my pants.

1530
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,171
Lovely story.

1531
01:27:17,255 --> 01:27:20,675
The point is I'm not the type of person
who disrupts things

1532
01:27:20,759 --> 01:27:23,052
just so I can shit comfortably.

1533
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:40,236
Noich, noich, noich
Smoking weed, smoking weed

1534
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,446
Doing coke, drinking beers

1535
01:27:42,531 --> 01:27:43,864
Pack of wraps, my good man.

1536
01:27:43,949 --> 01:27:46,951
Time to kick back, drink some beers,
and smoke some weed.

1537
01:27:47,035 --> 01:27:50,162
-Done poisoning the youth for today?
-Hell yes, whatever that means.

1538
01:27:50,247 --> 01:27:52,373
Now it's time to head over to Atlantic,

1539
01:27:52,457 --> 01:27:55,543
drink some beers, get ripped,
and hopefully get laid.

1540
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:58,379
-One seventy-nine.
-Pay the good man.

1541
01:27:59,089 --> 01:28:01,549
-Yeah, you close soon?
-In half an hour.

1542
01:28:01,633 --> 01:28:04,009
We get off the same time every day.
We should hang out.

1543
01:28:04,094 --> 01:28:05,928
-You get high?
-I should start.

1544
01:28:06,012 --> 01:28:07,179
Wanna come to this party
with me tonight?

1545
01:28:07,264 --> 01:28:09,140
There's gonna be
some pussy there, man.

1546
01:28:09,224 --> 01:28:10,683
With you? I don't think so.

1547
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:13,310
Oh, look at you.
"I don't hang out with drug dealers."

1548
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:15,062
Nothing personal.

1549
01:28:15,147 --> 01:28:17,940
-What happened with that old guy?
-He died in the bathroom.

1550
01:28:18,024 --> 01:28:20,025
Well, I heard he was jerking off
or something.

1551
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:21,777
I don't know, I wasn't watching.

1552
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:25,322
He probably saw that Caitlin chick.
I felt like beating it when I saw her.

1553
01:28:25,407 --> 01:28:27,575
Come here, bitch. You like this, huh?

1554
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:29,285
-Is this what you want?
-Knock it off.

1555
01:28:29,411 --> 01:28:32,997
-That used to be my girlfriend, all right?
-You used to go out with her?

1556
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:35,166
Yeah, well, I thought
we might be starting again.

1557
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:38,085
-Don't you already have a girlfriend?
-Yeah, Veronica.

1558
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:40,796
And what, you're gonna dump her
for that Caitlin chick?

1559
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:42,089
Maybe.

1560
01:28:42,174 --> 01:28:43,841
I don't know, dude.
That Caitlin chick's nice.

1561
01:28:43,925 --> 01:28:46,761
But I see that Veronica girl
doing shit for you all the time.

1562
01:28:46,845 --> 01:28:50,055
I saw her rubbing your back,
fucking comes and brings your food.

1563
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,474
Didn't I see her change your tire once?

1564
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:53,225
Hey, hey, I jacked up the car.

1565
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:55,978
All she did was unloosen the nuts
and put the tire on.

1566
01:28:56,062 --> 01:28:59,273
-I don't know, she does a lot for you.
-She's my girlfriend.

1567
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:00,775
I had some girlfriends too,

1568
01:29:00,859 --> 01:29:03,444
but all they wanted from me
was weed and shit.

1569
01:29:03,528 --> 01:29:04,695
Shit, my grandma used to say,

1570
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:08,491
"What's better, fucking,
a good plate with nothing on it. . ."

1571
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:09,742
No, wait. I fucked up.

1572
01:29:09,826 --> 01:29:12,286
"What's a good plate
with nothing on it?"

1573
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:14,497
-Meaning?
-I don't know, she was senile and shit.

1574
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:17,208
She used to fucking piss herself
all the time

1575
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:18,876
and shit herself.

1576
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,296
Come on, Silent Bob. Let's get
the fuck out of this fucking gyp-joint

1577
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,342
with this fucking faggot, Dante.
You cock-smoker.

1578
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:29,929
There's a million
fine-looking women in the world,

1579
01:29:30,013 --> 01:29:32,097
but they don't all bring you
lasagna at work.

1580
01:29:32,182 --> 01:29:34,475
Most of them just cheat on you.

1581
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,811
Come on, limp dick.

1582
01:29:37,646 --> 01:29:39,313
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1583
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:41,982
He's right.

1584
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,735
I love her.

1585
01:29:45,946 --> 01:29:47,112
So that's it.

1586
01:29:47,197 --> 01:29:49,657
He doesn't love you anymore.
He loves Caitlin.

1587
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:52,326
-And he told you all of this?
-Pretty much.

1588
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:54,286
All except
the latent homosexuality part,

1589
01:29:54,371 --> 01:29:56,247
that's just my theory.

1590
01:29:56,957 --> 01:29:59,250
-I don't know what to say.
-Well, don't hold it against him.

1591
01:29:59,334 --> 01:30:02,002
I mean, he just never
got Caitlin out of his system.

1592
01:30:02,087 --> 01:30:04,880
It's not your fault. It's Dante.

1593
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:08,300
Look, I don't know thing one
about chicks,

1594
01:30:08,385 --> 01:30:11,345
so if you gotta cry or something,
I can get out of here.

1595
01:30:11,429 --> 01:30:13,138
-I'm not sad.
-You're not?

1596
01:30:14,599 --> 01:30:15,683
What did you do that for?

1597
01:30:15,767 --> 01:30:18,269
If you didn't wanna go out with me,
why didn't you say so?

1598
01:30:18,353 --> 01:30:20,938
Instead, you pussyfoot around
and see that slut behind my back.

1599
01:30:21,022 --> 01:30:23,732
-What are you talking about?
-You've been talking to her.

1600
01:30:23,817 --> 01:30:25,943
-It was only a few times.
-And then you pull that shit.

1601
01:30:26,027 --> 01:30:28,112
Freaking out because
I've gone down on a couple guys.

1602
01:30:28,196 --> 01:30:29,280
Oh, a couple?

1603
01:30:29,364 --> 01:30:31,949
I'm not the one
trying to patch things up with my ex,

1604
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:33,117
sneaking behind your back.

1605
01:30:33,201 --> 01:30:35,995
If you think that 37 dicks are a lot,
then you just wait.

1606
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:37,788
I'll put the hookers
in Times Square to shame

1607
01:30:37,873 --> 01:30:39,373
with all the guys I go down on now.

1608
01:30:39,457 --> 01:30:41,333
-Will you let me explain.
-Explain what?

1609
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:44,712
How you've been waiting
and were going to dump me for her?

1610
01:30:44,796 --> 01:30:46,964
-It isn't like that.
-Damn right it isn't like that.

1611
01:30:47,048 --> 01:30:49,466
Because I won't let it be like that.
You want your slut?

1612
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:51,552
-Fine, the slut is yours.
-I don't want Caitlin.

1613
01:30:51,636 --> 01:30:53,137
You don't know what you want,

1614
01:30:53,221 --> 01:30:55,472
but I'm not going to sit here
holding your hand anymore

1615
01:30:55,557 --> 01:30:58,517
until you figure it out.
I've tried with you, Dante.

1616
01:30:58,602 --> 01:31:00,644
I've encouraged you
to get out of this fucking dump

1617
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:03,814
and go back to school, to take charge
of your life and find direction.

1618
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:05,941
I even transferred
so you would be more inclined

1619
01:31:06,026 --> 01:31:07,443
to go back to college if I was with you.

1620
01:31:07,527 --> 01:31:11,030
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but I didn't care because I loved you

1621
01:31:11,114 --> 01:31:12,656
and wanted to see you pull yourself

1622
01:31:12,741 --> 01:31:14,325
out of this senseless funk
that you've been in

1623
01:31:14,409 --> 01:31:16,535
since that whore dumped you
so many years ago.

1624
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,413
And now you wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over some more?

1625
01:31:19,497 --> 01:31:21,790
-I don't wanna go. . .
-Of course not, not now.

1626
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:24,501
Now you're trying to snake out
of doing what you wanted to do.

1627
01:31:24,586 --> 01:31:26,754
Well, I won't let you.
I want you to follow through,

1628
01:31:26,838 --> 01:31:29,006
so you can find out
what an idiot you are.

1629
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,675
And when she dumps you again,
and I promise you that she will.

1630
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,511
When she dumps you again,
I want to laugh at you.

1631
01:31:34,596 --> 01:31:37,514
Just so you realize that that was
what you gave up our relationship for.

1632
01:31:37,599 --> 01:31:39,892
I'm just glad that Randal
had the balls to tell me.

1633
01:31:39,976 --> 01:31:41,101
Randal?

1634
01:31:41,186 --> 01:31:44,647
Having him tell me, that was
the weakest move. You're spineless.

1635
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:46,982
-Veronica, I love you.
-Fuck you.

1636
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:04,625
Dante?

1637
01:32:36,908 --> 01:32:38,492
How's your eye?

1638
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,371
The swelling's not that bad,
but the FDS stings.

1639
01:32:43,999 --> 01:32:47,126
-How's your neck?
-It's kind of hard to swallow.

1640
01:32:48,503 --> 01:32:50,421
You didn't have to choke me,
you know.

1641
01:32:50,505 --> 01:32:51,880
Why did you tell Veronica

1642
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:53,799
that I was gonna dump her
to go back with Caitlin?

1643
01:32:53,883 --> 01:32:57,052
-I thought I was doing you a favor.
-Jesus.

1644
01:32:57,137 --> 01:32:59,722
You were always saying
how you can't initiate change yourself.

1645
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:02,516
-I thought I'd give you a hand.
-Thanks.

1646
01:33:03,518 --> 01:33:05,102
You still didn't have to choke me.

1647
01:33:05,186 --> 01:33:08,147
Oh, please.
I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

1648
01:33:08,231 --> 01:33:11,734
-Why do you say that?
-Why do I say that? Randal. . .

1649
01:33:11,818 --> 01:33:12,901
-Forget it.
-No, really.

1650
01:33:12,986 --> 01:33:15,529
-What did I do that was so wrong?
-What don't you do?

1651
01:33:15,613 --> 01:33:18,782
Sometimes I think the reason you come
to work is to make my life miserable.

1652
01:33:18,867 --> 01:33:20,409
How do you figure?

1653
01:33:20,493 --> 01:33:23,412
-What time did you get to work today?
-Like 1 0:00 or 1 0 after.

1654
01:33:23,496 --> 01:33:26,874
You were over half an hour late.
Then all you do is come in here.

1655
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:28,292
Yeah, to talk to you.

1656
01:33:28,376 --> 01:33:30,544
Which means the video store
is ostensibly closed.

1657
01:33:30,628 --> 01:33:32,421
Oh, it's not like I'm miles away.

1658
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:34,465
Unless you're out renting
at other video stores.

1659
01:33:34,549 --> 01:33:37,760
Hermaphrodites.
I rented it so we could watch it together.

1660
01:33:37,844 --> 01:33:39,303
You get me slapped with a fine,

1661
01:33:39,387 --> 01:33:42,014
you argue with the customers
and I have to patch everything up.

1662
01:33:42,098 --> 01:33:44,391
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating a corpse.

1663
01:33:44,476 --> 01:33:46,977
And to top it all off,
you ruin my relationship.

1664
01:33:47,062 --> 01:33:48,395
I mean, what's your encore?

1665
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:52,566
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?

1666
01:33:54,694 --> 01:33:58,155
You know what the real tragedy
about all this is?

1667
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,157
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

1668
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:01,825
Oh, fuck you.

1669
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:03,410
Fuck you, pal.

1670
01:34:03,828 --> 01:34:05,704
Jesus, there you go
trying to pass the buck.

1671
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:07,706
I'm the source of all your misery.

1672
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:11,585
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?

1673
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:13,378
Who tried to win back his ex-girlfriend

1674
01:34:13,463 --> 01:34:16,256
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?

1675
01:34:16,341 --> 01:34:19,093
You wanna blame somebody,
blame yourself.

1676
01:34:19,677 --> 01:34:23,347
"I'm not even supposed to be here
today." You sound like an asshole.

1677
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:25,682
Jesus, nobody twisted your arm
to be here.

1678
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:27,518
You're here of your own volition.

1679
01:34:27,602 --> 01:34:30,062
You think the weight of the world
rests on your shoulders,

1680
01:34:30,146 --> 01:34:33,190
like this place would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

1681
01:34:33,274 --> 01:34:36,693
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

1682
01:34:36,778 --> 01:34:38,278
You push fucking buttons.

1683
01:34:38,363 --> 01:34:41,240
Anybody can waltz in here
and do our jobs.

1684
01:34:41,991 --> 01:34:44,785
You're so obsessed with making it
seem so much more epic,

1685
01:34:44,869 --> 01:34:47,287
so much more important
than it really is.

1686
01:34:47,372 --> 01:34:50,082
Christ, you work
in a convenience store, Dante.

1687
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:51,875
And badly, I might add.

1688
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,045
I work in a shitty video store.
Badly, as well.

1689
01:34:55,505 --> 01:34:57,047
That guy Jay's got it right, man.

1690
01:34:57,132 --> 01:34:59,383
He has no delusions
about what he does.

1691
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:01,718
Us, we like to make ourselves
seem so much more important

1692
01:35:01,803 --> 01:35:03,512
than the people that come in here
to buy a paper,

1693
01:35:03,596 --> 01:35:05,389
or God forbid, cigarettes.

1694
01:35:05,473 --> 01:35:07,724
We look down on them,
as if we're so advanced.

1695
01:35:07,809 --> 01:35:12,271
Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
then what are we doing working here?

1696
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:34,209
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I whipped the cat next door.

1697
01:35:34,377 --> 01:35:35,460
Need a ride home?

1698
01:35:35,545 --> 01:35:37,671
No, got one. Just pulled up.

1699
01:35:38,173 --> 01:35:39,339
You working tomorrow?

1700
01:35:39,424 --> 01:35:42,384
-Same time. What about you?
-I'm calling out.

1701
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,012
Going to the hospital and visit Caitlin.

1702
01:35:45,096 --> 01:35:47,431
And then I'm gonna
try to talk to Veronica.

1703
01:35:47,515 --> 01:35:48,849
You wanna grab a bite to eat
or something

1704
01:35:48,933 --> 01:35:51,685
when you're done with that
and I get off work?

1705
01:35:51,769 --> 01:35:53,604
I'll give you a call. Let you know.

1706
01:35:53,688 --> 01:35:54,771
All right.

1707
01:35:54,856 --> 01:35:56,565
Hey, good luck with Veronica.

1708
01:35:56,649 --> 01:35:59,651
-If you want, I can talk to her. . .
-No, thanks.

1709
01:35:59,736 --> 01:36:01,612
I think I can handle it.

1710
01:36:01,696 --> 01:36:04,198
We have a lot of shit to talk about.

1711
01:36:04,574 --> 01:36:06,992
-Hell of a day.
-To say the least.

1712
01:36:07,869 --> 01:36:10,829
Want me to do anything
before I get out of here, man?

1713
01:36:10,914 --> 01:36:13,624
-Why don't you wrangle for me?
-No.

1714
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:15,667
-Come on, just wrangle out the door.
-No.

1715
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:17,711
-Come on.
-No, no, no.

1716
01:36:17,879 --> 01:36:22,090
Here comes Randal
He's a berserker

1717
01:36:29,599 --> 01:36:31,099
You're closed.

1718
01:39:22,897 --> 01:39:24,856
Smoking weed, smoking weed

1719
01:39:24,941 --> 01:39:28,610
Noich, noich, noich
Smoking weed, smoking weed
